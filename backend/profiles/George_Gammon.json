      "content": "Hello fellow rebel capitalists. Hope\nyou're well. So we've got new inflation\ndata out today. The\nPCE report from the Bureau of Economic\nAnalysis, I believe. And spoiler alert,\nit's down less than expected. But I\nthink what's even more important is\nwhat's happening month over month. And\nthen we have to see the details and\ndetermine how is this going to impact\nwhat the Fed is doing. Because remember\nthe Fed says that they pay more\nattention to the PCE than they do the\nCPI. And when you're looking at them,\nyou know, their target rate getting that\ndown to 2% inflation. You got to focus\non where the PCE is. This is very\nimportant. And we're going to go into\nhow markets are responding. the stock\nmarket, gold, Bitcoin, and of course,\ninterest rates in the bond market, which\nas you guys know, I think is the most\nimportant. So, first and foremost, let's\ngo over to CNBC. We're going to get a\nsummary, and then we're going to go over\nto the Bureau of Economic Analysis\nwebsite and go over some charts, some\ndetails. And um another thing that I'll\nshare with you before we get going is\nthis is the lowest inflation rate based\non this metric that we have seen going\nall the way back to the survea sickness.\nWe tied it in September of 2024. Now\nwe're right back down and that's a level\nthat we hadn't seen since I believe\nFebruary of 2021. But we're going to get\ninto that in just a moment. First, let's\ngo over to the CNBC web page. And by the\nway, for you diehard Rebel Capitalist\nfans, I've got a very special surprise\nfor you at the end of this video. Super\nsuper cool. So, if you're a fan of the\nRebel Capitals brand and the Rebel\nCapitals channel, you're definitely\ngoing to want to stay tuned to the end\nof this video. All right, so let's shoot\nover to CNBC. Got inflation rate spiked\nor excuse me, spiked. inflation rate\nslipped a little bit different there to\n2.1% in April lower than expected. This\nis the Fed's preferred gauge. So key\ntalking points there's a PCE personal\nconsumption\nexpenditures. Now what's when we get\ninto this article you'll see it's not\njust about what's happening with the PCE\nit's also what's happening with retail\nsales and consumption. And keep in mind\nwhen we get into those numbers, they're\nnot adjusted for inflation. So if you\nsee a 0.1% month- over-month, that is\nnot real uh literally and\nfiguratively, meaning that's not\nadjusted for inflation. So if we had any\ninflation this month, then that's going\nto be a negative number or close to it\ndepending on the degree to which we had\ninflation. Okay. So let's see here. Key\ntalking\npoint.1% for the month. And this is what\nI like to focus on because at the\n2.1% year-over-year, you get a lot of\nbase effects. So, let's just assume the\num you know, 12 months back we had a I\ndon't know a 0.9 or something like that.\nWell, that falls off and then this month\nit's just a 0.5. what's going to\ndramatically drop the PCE\nyear-over-year, but that doesn't really\ntell us anything about what's happening\nmore recently to prices. That's why you\nalso have to look at the month over\nmonth. Very important. And just to\nreiterate, the month-over-month\nis.1% increase. Okay. Now, the core,\nthis is minus the volatile food and\nenergy. They always have to say the\nvolatile for some reason.\nThis comes in at 0.1 as well and it's at\nso the year-over-year is 2.5 and\nremember the Fed's target is\n2%. So I mean you're getting pretty darn\nclose but this\nalso really shows how ridiculous that\ntarget number is. So you're telling me\nFederal Reserve if we're at 2.1% well oh\nmy gosh you've got to be hawkish. we\nhave to be hawkish because oh, you know,\nwe're really risking inflation to the\nupside or we're really risking letting\nthat inflation genie get out of the\nbottle. We're really risking quote\nunquote\nstagflation. But if the CP or the PCE\nis.9, so 20 basis points lower, then all\nof a sudden, holy cow, we got to worry\nabout deflation. It's we got to cut\nASAP. We got to do QE or else we're\ngoing to go into a deflationary death\nspiral. You know, that's how ridiculous\nthis this number is. Just this totally\narbitrary, by the way, 2% number. And I\nthink it also reveals how ridiculous the\nFederal Reserve is to begin with, and\nhow they're really not uh, you know,\nSnyder always says, I totally agree with\nhim, they're really not a central bank.\nthey're just kind of a it's all smoke\nand\nmirrors or I think what he says is the\ncentral bank isn't central and uh once\nyou really start to get into the\nmonetary system you you see that that\nit's just so true and the only thing\nthat they have is just these scops where\nthey try to make you believe that they\nsomehow control interest rates as\nopposed to interest rates just being a\nreflection of what's actually happening\nin the real economy. Consumer spending\nthough slowed sharply posting just a 2%\nincrease. I think I said it was 0.1\nearlier while the savings rate surged to\n4.9. So this is really interesting.\nNumber one, remember that 0.2 doesn't\nadjust for inflation. Number two, if the\ninflation rate went up to 4, excuse me,\nthe savings rate went up to 4.9%. Well,\nthere's two reasons why that likely\nhappened. Number one, the American\nconsumer is just making so much money\nbecause the labor market is so\nincredible that they're just making way\nmore money than they can even\nspend. That's option number one. And I\nwould agree with most of you watching\nthis video right now. You're probably\nsaying to yourself, okay, that's a\npretty low\nprobability. But option number two is\nthey are in the trenches every day and\nthey really have their finger. They the\nAmerican consumer have their finger on\nthe pulse what's really happening in the\nlabor market and they can sense that the\nlabor market is softening and things are\ngetting a little bit worse and therefore\nthey're just trying to prepare for a\nrainy day. So those are your two\noptions. Obviously, I would lean more\ntoward the latter, but you can come to\nyour own\nconclusion. So, like we said there,\ninflation barely budged in April. Month\nover month, year-over-year, it went\ndown.\nuh as President Trump tariff implemented\nuh in early part of the month had yet to\nshow up in the consumer\nprices excluding volatile food and\nenergy. The core reading tends to get\neven greater focus from the Fed showed\n0.1 as well and like we said earlier\nthat's 2.5%\nyearoveryear. Now the estimates were 0.1\nand 2.6. So that year-over-year that was\nslightly below estimates as well.\nConsumer spending though slowed like we\nsaid earlier 02% increase uh in line\nwith consensus but slower than the 7 in\nMarch. So we're seeing a decline there.\nThe more cautious consumer mood also was\nreflected in personal savings rate and I\nwould agree with CNBC here. I think this\nis definitely because the consumer is\nmore cautious about the overall economy\nin the labor market as opposed to\nthey're just flushed with cash and they\ncan't even spend it\nall. Trump has been pushing the Fed to\nlower the key interest rate. We talked\nabout this in yesterday's video and I\nI've got to agree with Trump right here.\nUh I I don't necessarily agree with his\ntactics, but he's right. I think the Fed\nhas rates way too high and you know the\nECB all these other central banks at\nleast in the developed countries are\ndropping rates. I mean South Korea I\nthink it was a bank that dropped rates\nyesterday and I think the Fed is as\nusual kind of behind the curve here. Now\nthe argument is that no no you know\ninflation is still sticky. It's still\nabove the 2% target rate and we have a\nstrong labor market. We have all of this\nsavings that's just pent up demand and\nthere and we also have the tariffs that\ncould increase the prices of some goods\nand once inflation expectations set in\nto the overall economy then that's going\nto lead to higher and higher and higher\nand higher prices like this spiral that\nthey always talk about. And I I get the\nargument, but I just don't agree with it\nbecause I think in order to have that\naccelerated inflation, which you would\nexpect to see in a stagflationary\nenvironment, you have to have nominal\nwages go up. It's a it's simple. You\nyou've got to have wages going up. And I\nthink, you know, they might be going up,\nbut they're not going up at the rate\nthat consumer goods and services have\ngone up over the past two or three\nyears. And so you've got on net a\nnegative aggregate\ndemand. And so even if you do have the\nprices going up at Walmart because of\nXYZ tariff on China, well that's fine\nthat people have to pay the higher\nprices and you will see that component\nof the basket of goods go up, but that\nmeans they're just taking spending away\nfrom something else that doesn't have\ntariffs. So, the example I always use\nis, okay, well, let's just say that\nyou're buying this much stuff at Walmart\nand this many airline tickets. All\nright. Well, let's say that the price of\nthe stuff at Walmart goes up here. Your\npaycheck doesn't go up by that much. So,\nthe amount of airline tickets that\nyou're able to buy goes down. So, it is\ntrue that these prices are going up, but\nthese prices are likely going down. So,\nwhen you look at the basket of goods,\nyou don't have much of an increase.\nAnd I think that's pretty much what\nwe're seeing here. Uh the other thing\nthat I think we'll probably discuss in\nthis video is the\nfact the GDP, excuse me, the uh trade\ndeficit went down substantially. Now,\nwhy is that important? Because the trade\ndeficit was a drag on GDP. That's one of\nthe main reasons we had a negative\nnumber. And so a lot of the bulls or a\nlot of the people that are kind of in\nthe inflation camp or the stagflation\ncamp, they say, \"All right, once we get\nthe past frontloading of these purchases\nfor which increase the trade deficit, by\nthe way, once we get past that, then the\neconomy is or the GDP number is going to\nexplode higher because you're not going\nto have that drag on the overall GDP\nformula due to the trade deficit, which\nwhich is usually let's just say 100\nbillion going up to 180 billion or\nwhatever it was. But this I think\nis this optimism if you will about the\nGDP I think is misplaced because it\ntotally ignores the rest of the\ncomponents that went into the equation\nthat got the negative.2 or.3% to begin\nwith. More on that in just a moment\nhere. So uh Trump faces off with pal\ntoday. say that a a meeting and I\ntweeted about this. I won't bring it up\nbut\nbasically the tweet was talking I think\nit was from um market watch or something\nlike that and they were discussing how\nyou know Trump wants to bring rates down\nto boost the economy and POW wants to\nkeep rates higher because that's going\nto put a strangle hold on the last bits\nof inflation. And my my comment here,\nwhich is something I really try to drive\nhome constantly, it's that that the\ninterest rates really don't control the\neconomy to the extent that people think\nthey do or the Fed would lead you to\nbelieve or to the extent that Trump uh\nthinks they impact the economy. So he\nsaid he always talks about how the ECB\nhas such a great advantage because they\nhave lower interest rates than we do.\nBut you got to be careful what you wish\nfor because the reason they have lower\ninterest rates is because their economy\nsucks.\ntheir economy is worse than the United\nStates. That's why they have lower\ninterest\nrates. So my my point is that whenever\nyou're thinking about interest rates,\ndon't don't really think about interest\nrates in terms of controlling the\neconomy, which is where most people\nstart. Think about interest rates as\njust simply a price signal.\nAnd what those signals are telling you\nis they're telling you about the\nstrength or lack thereof of the real\neconomy. They're simply a reflection of\nwhat's happening in the economy and what\nthe expectations are for the economy.\nThey aren't necessarily a tool just to\nbludgeon the economy over the head and\nforce it into submission to do whatever\nit is that you want it to do. So, as an\nexample, I would strongly encourage you\nto go back in time and see when the Fed\ndropped rates where the economy was\nactually quote unquote\nstimulated. What? Show me a time when\nthe Fed dropped rates and that led to\neconomic growth. You can point to one\ntime that was 19 uh 95 and we didn't\nhave all these inverted curves and we\ndidn't have negative uh swap spreads. we\ndidn't have a lot of these other\ncomponents. So, you know, even with\nthat, you've got 90% of the time when\nthe Fed drops rates, it it doesn't do\nanything. It doesn't it doesn't prevent\nthe stuff from hitting the fan. The\nstuff still hits the fan. Why? Because\nthose lower interest rates are a\nreflection of the economy. They don't\ncontrol the economy.\nGetting back to\nthis, economists worry tariffs could\nspark another round of inflation, though\nhistorical records show their impact is\noften minimal, right? With the exact\nsame things that we discuss on this\nchannel, and we talked about that\nyesterday on the video, where even if\nthey do lead to price increases on this\ncomponent of the basket, let's say the\nWalmart component, it's just it's a\nprice adjustment. It it's it's not okay\nthe prices go up by 10% because of a 10%\ntariff and then the next month they go\nup by another 10% and another 10% and\nanother you know they don't keep\naccelerating they just adjust higher.\nNow is that going to impact the consumer\nnegatively? Absolutely it will. But over\na long period of time if you zoom out\nit's not really going to show up in a\nhuge acceleration in the CPI. It's more\nso going to show up in a decrease in\neconomic\noutput. Okay. Now, let's go over the\nBureau of Economic Analysis. Let's look\nat some charts. And this first one, see,\ndisposable personal income outlays and\nsavings. Aha. Okay. So, this orange is\nthe outlay percentage change. So, big\ndrop there. That's what CNBC was\nreferring to. But then we have that big\nincrease in the savings rate. And by the\nway, we've seen this trend higher since\npretty much the uh Q4 of 2024, which I\nthink in of itself says a\nlot. Here are the\nchanges,\nhuh? So you see the good side of the the\nequation here was really dragging it\ndown and then the services side\nincreased it\nsubstantially. This is what I was\nreferring to earlier how we haven't been\nat 2.1% since the middle part of 2024.\nBut if you look back further you would\nhave to go back to 2021. I believe it\nwas February of\n2021. And here's kind of a summary of\nthe overall numbers that we went over\nwith that CNBC\narticle. So now what I'd like to do is\ngo to and I I forgot to pull this up.\nYou'll have to bear with me. Let's go to\num last\nGDP\nreport and hopefully we can get a chart\nof the\ncomponents of GDP. Let's keep our\nfingers crossed.\nUh let's actually see if we can just go\nto an\nimage and I do not see it. Okay. So\nlet's try something else here.\nWe're going to go components\nof real\nGDP, net exports, government spending,\ninvestment. So the one main thing I want\nto focus on or two main things I want to\nfocus on inventory. Here we go. Here we\ngo.\nUh, let's just show me the\ndarn. All right, Josh, you can see that,\nright? Yes. Okay. So, guys, th these are\nthe inputs to GDP. And so, what most\npeople focus on, especially the people\nthat are are very bullish, are the net\nexports. In other words, the deficit.\nSo if we have a $180 billion deficit,\ntrade deficit, that's a subtraction from\nGDP. That's a subtraction for GD from\nGDP because what it's really trying to\ndecipher is the amount of goods and\nservices that were actually created\nhere. So, you've got to take all the\num the aggregate total of everything\nthat was purchased and then you've got\nto subtract the the deficit because\nalthough that was purchased here, you\ncan tell broadly speaking that that\nwasn't actually produced\nhere. But then these other components\nare very important as well. So, we've\ngot inventories. Now this is something I\nwant to highlight because last month\nwhat you saw is a huge drag on GDP which\nis one of the main reasons we got down\nto negative.2 or negative.3 but you had\na huge spike in\ninventories. So that huge spike in\ninventories\nincreased GDP all else being equal and\nthe huge spike in the deficit the trade\ndeficit decreased GDP. So this next\nmonth or this last print that we had\ntoday. Now let me go over that real\nquick here so you guys are following\nkind of my line of thought. Uh this\nis and okay this is US trade deficit and\ngoods plummets in April pointing to\nstronger second quarter GDP. So you see\nwhat they're doing there. They're just\nassuming that the only reason we had a\nnegative GDP last time was just due to\nthis trade deficit. So if you strip that\nout, then hey, we're going to be at like\n10% GDP. But that's I think that that's\nnot really understanding the nuance\nhere, which is incredibly important. So\nthe last number we had\n162 and this time it goes down to 87. So\nyou're basically going to about have $80\nbillion that is not going to be\nsubtracted from GDP. And okay, that's\ngreat. But most people just myopically\nfocus on that and they forget everything\nelse. So if we had inventories explode\nhigher, which added to GDP last time,\nand that was because everyone was front\nrunning these tariffs, well, this month\nthey're likely not going to frontr run\nthe tariffs. And you can tell that by\nthe trade deficit dropping so much. So\nit is true that an $87 billion deficit\nas opposed to 162 or what it was will be\na net positive the reduction in\ninventories will be a net\nnegative. So you can't say you can't sit\nthere and say that just because we had a\nreduction in four means that GDP this\nnext print is going to be just blowout.\nNow, it could, but it all depends on\nthese inventories. And I would assume\nthat the inventories are going to be way\nlower than they were last month because\nthe deficit went down to begin with. I\njust wanted to throw that in there. So\nyou guys uh because I know a lot of the\nrhetoric in the mainstream media and on\nsocial media is all about how last\nmonth's number really didn't matter as\nfar as the GDP. And maybe it didn't.\nMaybe we'll see this blowout quarter,\nbut it would have to be a result of\ninventories keeping up to the same level\nthat they were when everyone was front\nrunning these tariffs. And I think that\nprobability is pretty low.\nSo, now let's go over to markets and see\nhow everything responded today to this\nlower than expected\nPCE. All\nright, so about flat, nothing too\nextreme. Now, Treasury yields down to\n4.4%. And we've talked about this\nnarrative that is just kind of bizarre\nto me that everyone look if you look at\nfinit almost every single tweet is just\nwell bonds are going up every day you\nknow yields yields well this is crazy\nbecause yields are going up every day or\nyields have exploded higher. Um no no\nthey haven't. I mean we did this\nyesterday but here's a one-year chart of\nthe 10-year Treasury yield.\nOkay, we're we're flat. And sure, you\nhad a a big spike up here, you know,\nduring uh liberation day or after that.\nI think that was April 9th. Then it came\nright back down. And then you have the\nbig pause. So growth expectations\nincrease. You have a big spike. Now you\nget softening data goes back down. I\nmean, if if you just ignored a chart and\nignored the actual yield and just\nfocused on social media, you would think\nthat the 10-year Treasury yield is at\nlike\n57%. And it's going up by 5% every day\nor something. So, just kind of bear that\nin mind when you're listening to the\nmainstream media or just scrolling\nthrough social media. Now, Bitcoin, this\nwas really interesting to me because it\nbroke through that resistance level like\n106 and you know, we got to like 111\n112. I thought it was off to the races,\nbut I was not correct in that. And I'm\nnot talking about long-term. I'm just\ntalking about short-term trade there.\nSo, I got that one wrong for sure. And\nthen gold down a bit today. I think the\nbig one to watch is oil. We talked about\nthis yesterday. down slightly today, but\nwe're getting real close\nto, you know, oil trading in the 50s,\nwhich I think is just a direct\nreflection of global demand. And that\nthe downside here isn't really dramatic\nacceleration of inflation, unless we get\na huge supply shock, which we very well\ncould see. But the the the bigger risk,\nI think, is kind of deflationary\npressures from the global economy really\nreally slowing.\nAnother thing that I'd like to point out\nin regards to the Fed is the 2-year\nTreasury yield. Let's check that out\nreal quick.\nSo, a similar\nstory to the 10-year, but I think this\nis even more dramatic where this is a\nsix-month chart of the 2-year. And like\nwe were saying, if you listen to the\nmainstream media, if you listen to\nsocial media, you would think that the\n2-year Treasury yield is just\nskyrocketing and just totally out of\ncontrol. And every single day, it's just\ngoing higher and higher and higher. when\nyou look at the chart, you're like,\num, nope, not really. In fact, you know,\ntoday down at 3.91 and remember, Fed\nfunds is still at 4.33. So, I think the\ncurve has been inverted for so long,\npeople just forget that it's inverted\nand they don't pay any attention to it.\nThat the the two-year Treasury should\nnot be trading under the overnight rate\nset by the Fed. That that's that is not\nnormal. That's not normal. that that's\nnot telling the Fed rates are too high.\nThis is telling the Fed that rates are\nway way way too low. And every single\ntime we have this knee-jerk reaction\nhigher due\nto whatever, you know, the trade the the\ntariffs are on, they're off, they're on,\nthey're off, or we just get these, you\nknow, it's all noise, but you can see\nthat the trend is definitely lower. And\nlet's look at a three-year chart.\nSo, we go back to 2023 and look at this.\nGo back to 2024. The trend is is much\nmuch\nlower from call it 2023 in the 2-year\nTreasury. And this is what you really\ngot to pay attention to when trying to\nfigure out what the Fed's next move is.\nThe the two-year Treasury is telling you\nthat it's got to be lower. And the\ntwo-year Treasury is telling Jerome Pal\nthat he's too high right now.\nI mean, the last thing the two-year\nTreasury is telling you or the 10-year\nis that the market is worried about a\nreaceleration of inflation or\nstagflation. And I think the PCE today\njust backs that\nup. Okay. Now, for those Rebel\nCapitalist fans out there, the\nOGs, the people that really are all\nabout what Rebel Capitalist stands for,\nand that's freedom, liberty, and free\nmarket\ncapitalism. I've got a surprise for you.\nWe're going to switch up the screen\nshare. I don't know where Josh\nwent, but that's okay. We don't need\nJosh. Oh, there he is. So, we're going\nto switch up the screen share. We're\ngoing to go over\nto Here we\ngo. All right, Josh. So, can you see\nthis? Yeah, you can. All right. So, what\nI wanted to do because we've been\ntalking a lot about AI and it was really\na hot topic at Rebel Capitalist Live and\nI think that entrepreneurs, employees, I\nthink we all have to really think this\nstuff through and determine how this is\ngoing to impact the overall economy. I\nthink you got to start by how does it\nimpact your job? How does it impact your\nbusiness? And then you have to keep\ngoing up and up and up till you get to\nthat 30,000 foot level and say how is\nthis going to impact not just the US\neconomy but how is it going to impact\nthe global economy and then what are the\ncentral planners going to do in response\nand this is you know I've been talking\nabout UBI lately and\nwhatnot but this is a website called\nSunno and if you haven't checked this\nout I'd strongly suggest doing so and\nplaying around with it. It's a lot of\nfun. It's su\nn.com. And my editors, uh, we had a\nmeeting this morning about AI. So, I\nsuggested that they go over and check\nthis out. And I think when you play\naround with this, it'll you'll realize\nvery, very quickly how this is going to\nimpact so many industries and how it's\ngoing to impact jobs.\nAnd so, uh, one of my editors went and,\nuh, did this quick song and she did a\nsong on Rebel Capitalist. So, the Rebel\nCapitalist song. So, I wanted to share\nthat with you guys really quick and you\ncan let me know in the uh, chat or in\nthe comments what you think. But,\nuh, the the main reason I want to share\nthis song with you is number one, it's a\nsong about rebel c being a rebel\ncapitalist, which come on, that's super\ncool. And number two is so you can\nlisten to the song and then think about\nhow this is going to impact the music\nbusiness. And if it impacts the music\nbusiness to this degree, how much is AI\ngoing to\nimpact everything\nelse? So hopefully this works here. We\ndon't have Josh confirming that it does,\nbut we've got the screen share selected,\nso I'm almost sure it's going to work.\nAnd again, how this was done, guys, is\nyou just go to the website and then it\njust it has a prompt and you just simply\ntype in like a sentence or\ntwo. Like literally takes two seconds.\nYou type in a sentence on what you want\na song about and it has a couple\nkeywords in there. Like this keyword was\nrock, electric, gritty, male vocals.\nThose were the keywords. And then you\njust hit\ncreate. And 10 seconds later, you've got\na 3 minute and 19 or three uh minute 19\nsecond song on whatever you want. And in\nthis case, it's the the Rebel Capitalist\nsong. So, here we go. And by the way,\nthe the the lyrics are right here.\nBrick by brick they try to\nbind chains of control they've\ndesigned. We break them down with\ncallous\nhands. Freedom screams across the\nland. Rise up rebels, don't you\nfall. Free minds answer to your\ncall.\nMaring world and\ntrue lies with me and you.\nAll right. Now, before we go any\nfurther, I want to make sure that you\nguys can hear me. Can you guys hear\nthat? Yeah. It sounds like a Ford F-150\ncommercial. Yeah. Yeah, it does, doesn't\nit? That's totally You just pegged it.\nIt's like a a Nickelback song. And Okay,\nhere's Josh. You guys can hear that. So,\nnow let's listen to a couple more verses\nhere. And again, guy, I I want to\nrestate this is all AI and and this song\nwas created by one of my editors this\nmorning by simply typing\nin like a sentence or two and just\nhitting\ncreate. And 10 seconds later, out comes\nthis. And I think what we can do is I\ncan probably take the link and I'll put\nit in the chat for you guys. So, I don't\nknow that you have to set up an account,\nbut you can probably just click on the\nlink and listen to the song, you know,\ntonight or whenever you you want if you\nlike it. But let me know what you guys\nthink of the song. Let's keep listening.\nPaper kings with golden\nlies. Hide the truth in their\ndisguise. We train in honor, not in\nchains. Rebel fire fuels our\nveins. Rise up, rebels, don't you fall.\nFree mind is a no\ncalling world and\ntrue. With me and\nyou. There you go, guys. I won't play\nthe whole song. You get the gist of it.\nand we'll put the I'll put the uh link\nin fact let me do that right\nnow just before so I don't forget and\nhopefully you guys can listen to the\nsong without setting up an account but\nall you have to do to set up an account\nis just it's just your email just give\nhim a junk email or something like that\nand then you can look at the lyrics\nand there we\nOh, okay. Cool. So, that's the link and\nyou guys can check it out at your\nconvenience. You can play around at the\nwebsite. You can do your own song. When\nwe were at Rebel Capitalist Live, my\ngood friend Robert Helms, who I've got\nthe mastermind with with Kenny and and\nHartman and uh Russ Gray, uh he did a\nsong on his dog and it was like this\noldfashioned like country song. It was\nreally good. And you can I mean, if you\nasked me if this was AI, I'd probably be\nable to tell you, but it's still a super\ncool song. And you got to realize that\nthis is as bad as it's going to get. I\nmean, if it's this good now, just think\nabout a year from now or two years. I\nmean, it it's literally going to be\nwhere whatever you want to hear, going\nto the gym, you can just go to your\nphone, you can type in a sentence on\nwhatever type of song or whatever\nlyrics, you know, whatever you want the\nsong to be about, and you'll instantly\nhave it, and you can just listen to a\nnew song that you create every single\nday prior to going to the gym or or\ndoing whatever. I mean, it's really it's\nit's it's terrifying and it's\nsuper exciting like at the exact same\ntime. So, and but the reason I'm sharing\nwith this again twofold guys. Number\none, it's the Rebel Capitalist song. So,\ncome on. I mean, how cool is that? And\nnumber\ntwo, if this is where music is right\nnow, think about how this is going to\nimpact the music\nindustry. and then think about how this\nis going to impact other\nindustries in the US economy in the\nglobal economy and then think about what\nthe government's response to that is\ngoing to be. I think it's all about the\nmacro here. That's why main reason I\nwanted to share it with you guys. All\nright, on that\nbombshell, enjoy your weekend. As\nalways, make sure you are standing up\nfor freedom, liberty, free market\ncapitalism, and we'll see you on the\nnext video.",

      "content": "Hello fellow rebel capitals. Hope you're\nwell. So, as I'm sure you've heard, the\ncourt comes out and says that Trump\ncannot continue with his tariffs and the\nmarket explodes higher. The bond yields\ngo all over the place. This volatility\nwas Bitcoin crashes and then another\ncourt comes out and says, \"Well,\nactually, Trump can do the tariffs and\nnow there's all this uncertainty,\" which\nis kind of the word of 2025.\nSo let's dive into exactly what happened\nthen what happened today which actually\nkind of reversed the decision and then\nlook at what's happening in markets and\nthen look at how the Fed is responding\nto this because that's what's going to\ndrive interest rates at the front end of\nthe curve and then we can zoom out and\nkind of connect the dots from a\nstandpoint of macro and how this will\nimpact or how it will likely impact the\nUnited States and the global economy.\nmoving forward. So, first and foremost,\nlet's start by going over\nto what is this? Bloomberg, I think it\nis. And I actually got my highlighter\ntool working. So, that's good. Title or\nBaronss, excuse me. Court blocks trade\ncourt\nruling. So, first we had the court\nruling that blocked the tariffs and then\nwe had a court block the actual court\nruling. I mean, this this is part for\nthe course this year. It just gets so\nconfusing. It's difficult to determine\nwhat's up, what's down, what's right,\nwhat's left, what on earth is going on.\nBut that's why you tune in to the Rebel\nCapitals channel. They say what's next\nfor trade talks.\nSo federal appeals court on Thursday, so\nthat would be today, ordered a temporary\nstay that would allow tariffs to remain\nin effect while the court hears\narguments. Okay, so that's what happened\ntoday. But yesterday, on Wednesday, the\nUS courts of international trade ordered\nan injunction that gave the\nadministration 10 days to stop\ncollecting revenue. In other words,\ncancel the tariffs.\nthe trade court's injunction is now on\nhold. So hopefully you guys are are\nfollowing. Now I I think a lot of people\nthought and I know in the article\nsomeone from the Trump administration\nsays this is judicial overreach or court\noverreach. I I don't really know if I\nagree with that. It it seems like the\ncourts are kind of coming after Trump\nbecause of the tariffs. But if you look\nat the way that he imple Now this is not\nto\nsay the Trump tariffs are good or bad on\nnet balance. That's we'll save that for\na completely separate video. But it is\nto say that even if you like the Trump\ntariffs or you don't like the Trump\ntariffs, whatever it is, he still has to\nabide by the law at the end of the day.\nI don't think anyone, even if you're a\nreally, if you're the strongest\nproponent to the MAGA movement, I don't\neven think that person would be like,\n\"Well, I want Trump to do whatever he\nneeds to do, even if it's breaking the\nlaw because we just got to get stuff\ndone.\" Like, I don't even think they'd\ngo that far. So, my point here is this\nis a lawsuit that wasn't just generated\nout of thin air. it it was by some of\nthe small and mid-size businesses that\nare being impacted by the tariffs. So,\nmore on that in just a moment, but\ngetting back to\nthis. Okay. A court dealt a blow to\nPresident Trump's trade policy by\nruling. Okay, we've got\nthat. Now, what I was interested in is\nwhat tariffs. I mean, let's remember\nTrump has tariffs over here. He's got\nfentanyl tariffs. He's got cheating\ntariffs. He's got these tariffs and\nthose tariffs. It changes every single\nday. That's part of the deal according\nto the MAGA folks. But regardless, I I\nwant to know, okay, what tariffs are\nthese talking about? Is are these all\ntariffs? Are these the fentanyl tariffs?\nAre these the liberation day\ntariffs? As it turns out, it applies to\nall of them. But getting back to the\narticle, but the uncertainty is unlikely\nto ease. That's kind of the theme.\nfor this video that we know one of the\ndownsides to the tariffs is it creates a\nlot of uncertainty for businesses in the\ndomestic economy and it's like well what\ndo I want to build this house? I don't\nknow because today my costs are X where\ntomorrow my cost might be X plus Y but\nthen two weeks from now my cost might go\nback to being X or might be go a little\nbit lower. And so Trump, I mean, that's\nkind of his MMO. It's the snow globe\napproach. And that might be great for\nnegotiating, not so much for doing\nbusiness in the real economy. Even if\nyou're an advocate of the tariffs, I\nthink even that person, they're being\nhonest with themselves. They they say,\n\"Yeah, the uncertainty is there.\" And\nthat is the businesses are going to have\nto deal with that. That's just kind of\nthe shortterm pain that we have to go\nthrough to get these long-term benefits.\nI think that would be the\nargument. So if we can say definitively\nuncertainty is kind of a problem for\nbusinesses right now or has been this\njust adds even more uncertainty because\nnow you don't know which way it's going\nto go based on how Trump feels that day.\nAnd if he talked to Xi Jinping or he\ntalked\nto whoever Putin\nor you know Ursula over at the European\nUnion or Lagard at the ECB, whoever he\ntalks to, he he has kind of a different\nopinion. And so yesterday it might be\n140% tariff on China. And then the very\nnext day it might be, well, we discussed\nand we had lunch in Switzerland and uh\nwe're going to go ahead and do a 90-day\npause. And then the very next day we\ncould be back to well we're only going\nto do a 45day pause. So you got all this\nstuff going back and forth and back and\nforth. So now on top of this you have\nthe Trump uh let's say\nvolatility or lack of predictability at\nthe very least. And now we add another\nlayer of lack of uh\npredictability. And that's with the\ncourt system because even if Trump says\nthis, the next day he says that, even if\nit's contradicting, okay, fine. But now\nwe've got the courts contradicting\nthemselves. We've got one court saying\nthis, the other court saying that. I\nmean, I quite frankly fe feel very sorry\nfor small and business uh excuse me,\nsmall and mid-size businesses in the\nUnited States right now that are import\nexport companies. I mean, how on earth\ndo you navigate this? And every single\nday, it's like it becomes more and more\nand more\ncomplex. And like my good friend um\nLynette Zang says, a confused mind\nalways says no. And what that means is\nthat if you're a business, you just got\nto freeze and pretty much do nothing and\nthen be like, \"Okay, hopefully this\nsettles down a bit over the next month\nand then I can go ahead and take\naction.\" But until that time, I'm just\ngoing to short my balance sheet. I'm\njust going to make sure that my expenses\nare as low as possible. I'm not going to\ndo any R&D. I'm not going to hire\nanyone. I'm not going to take any risk.\nI'm just going to stay in my lane, keep\ndoing what I'm doing, and then just wait\nto see how this all plays out. I think\nthat would be the prudent, rational\napproach for a small midsize business\nowner in the United States, assuming\nthey have to deal with this export\nimport\nstuff. So, here's um okay, here we go.\nBut uncertainty unlikely to ease any\nmarket relief attributed directly to\nyesterday's ruling likely to be\nshort-lived once investors and companies\nunderstand the full scope of alternative\nand more\nlegal and more legally secure\nauthorities available to present said\nOwen Ted Ford beacon policy adviserss\nyeah it's\njust I mean it sucks if you're that\nbusiness owner because you're like okay\nI know I have to deal with Trump I know\nI have to deal with the tariffs let me\nsee if I can use some game theory here,\nbut now all of a sudden, out of nowhere,\nyou've got to add even more complexity\nto it with what the courts are doing\ngoing back and forth. White House press\nsecretary Carolyn Levit called the\nruling another example of judicial\noverreach.\nUh, I don't know. I I don't know. I\nmean, look, Trump is doing all these\nexecutive orders, and this is not\nsaying, this is not to say that the\nTrump tariffs are bad or good or any of\nthat, but you have to compartmentalize\nthat. Those are two completely separate\nquestions. Number one, are they legal?\nNumber two, are they good or bad? So,\nright now, we're just focusing are on\nare they were they implemented in a\nlegal way? I I don't know. I don't know.\nBut I do know that these suits were\nbrought forth by actual business owners.\nRight here, second federal court granted\nan injunction to two toy makers\nthat had filed a suit against the\nadministration because of the tariffs.\nUS District Judge Rudolph\nContrarus ordered the administration not\nto collect tariffs while the case works\nits way through the system.\nFor now, the court ruling holds. For\nnow, if the court ruling holds. So,\nagain, what we had today is just kind of\nsaying, all right, well, Trump can go\nahead and continue to collect the\ntariffs just while we're working this\nstuff through and but we don't\nnecessarily know what the court what the\nfinal court ruling will be.\nSo for now, going back to the Baron's\narticle, if the court ruling holds, the\nnew tariffs Trump's imposed against\nChina this term would collapse. So with\nthe 10% baseline tariff, the\nadministration has uh looked to as a\nfloor for trade negotiations. The\nreciprocal tariffs, key source of\nrevenue. So regardless of the revenue, I\nmean, he was obviously using this as a\nnegotiating tactic. And now whether you\nlike it or you don't, he he's going to\nhave a lot less negotiating leverage\nbecause like if I'm Xi Jinping or if I'm\nsomeone negotiating with the Trump\nadministration right now, I'm looking at\nthis and I'm, you know, next time I go\nto negotiate, if they're not going to\naccept my terms, I'm like, \"Okay, guys.\"\nBut let's be clear. Let's be honest. You\ncan sit here and talk tough all you\nwant, but we don't even know if your\ncourts are going to allow you to do what\nyou're saying. So, it it definitely\ngives our opponents, if you will, an\nupper hand for\nsure. It also doesn't do much to answer\nuh questions small business grappling\nwith. Okay, we talked about that\nearlier. They're using the example of\nthe toy maker suit. said before the\nruling on the case uh came\nthrough that was uh delighted with the\ncourt Wednesday night decision but added\nwe continue to face uncertainties that\nmake it very difficult to run our\nbusiness and just add to those\nuncertainties. Yesterday you're happy\nyou're delighted with the court's\ndecision and then\ntoday rug pole guess\nnot back to not having a clue what's\ngoing to happen over the next five\nminutes. Will tariffs continue to be\ncollected at what\nrates? It's a\nmess. Guessing wrong could cost big\nbucks. I doubt anyone will roll back\nprices based on decisions today, sadly.\nYeah, it's not just rolling back prices.\nLike we said earlier, it's just doing\nanything. Like if I was a a business\nowner in the United States where this\nwas impacting my business, I mean, what\nwould you do? I I would there. I\nwouldn't do anything. I I would freeze.\nI would just be like, \"Okay, no spending\nmoney. Let's tighten the belt. Let's\njust go as lean as possible and just\nsee. Let's not take any additional risk.\nNo R&D. Let's just wait. Keep doing what\nwe're doing and see how this plays\nout.\" So, the next question we have to\nask is how are markets responding? I\nknow last night they were way up and\nthen as we went through the day the S&P\n500 just kind of went down down down\ndown. Well, let's look at an actual\nchart. Uh S&P right here. We finished\nthe day slightly\npositive. So yeah, we get this big move\nup that would have\nbeen that was the\n26th. So today's the 29th. Let\nme Yeah. So we started the day way up\nand then we kind of like I said\ngradually went down and then you get\nnews that uh this is probably when we\nhad that the news come out that\nthey they blocked the court's decision\nfrom yesterday and then the market kind\nof just shrugged it off and came right\nback to where it was. And that's\nbasically where we ended the day. Lots\nof noise here. I don't know how the heck\nyou would play this market right now to\nthe upside or the downside. I don't even\nknow what I don't know how you determine\nthe probabilities just because\neverything's so there's so many things\nare just up in the air other than just\nlooking at the technicals. But let's go\nto some of the other major markets here\nsuch as bonds. You guys know I pay\nattention to that quite a bit. We got a\n10-year Treasury. Everyone's talking\nabout how the 10-year Treasury is just\ngoing up up up higher and higher and\nhigher. especially on Twitter. And\nwhat's weird is it's almost like they're\nnot looking at a chart.\nLike everyone talks about, oh my gosh,\nbond yields are going straight up.\nThey're just going up every day. No\nmatter what happens, bond yields just go\nhigher and higher and higher and\nhigher. It's\nlike, not not really. Have you looked at\na chart? They're not going straight up.\nThis pro proves my point. Right now,\nbond yields are lower than they were a\nyear ago on the\n10-year. So, and you say, \"Well, George,\nthis is just more\nrecently.\" Okay. I mean, recently\nthey're up over the last month uh 20\nbasis points, but over the last five\ndays they're down quite substantially,\nby the way. Over the last five days,\nthey're down 10 basis points.\nSo the I don't know how you can look at\nthis chart and say that that uh the\n10-year Treasury is just going straight\nup every single day regardless of what\ntype of news comes out. That's just not\ntrue. So anyway, uh this is how they\nreacted today. Just\nuh down about five basis points or so.\nAnd I you know what's driving the market\nright now? I think it's just growth and\ninflation expectations. Sometimes you\nget noise where it could be deficits\nthat can impact it over the short run,\nyou know, over a few days or you get\nthese knee-jerk reactions and whatnot,\nbut then it kind of just you have that\nuh self\num\nequiliberating process\nwhere the yields go up and they kind of\ncome right back down. The yields go down\ntoo far, they come right back up because\nthe bank's in there buying and selling.\nWe talk about that on pretty much every\none of my\nvideos. Um, so I just think that if the\ntariffs are off, okay, well, we can see\nsome upside to yields because that means\ngrowth is probably uh the expectations\nare increasing slightly, right? And then\nif we see it plummet, well, it's\nprobably means that is because the\ntariffs are back on or people think they\nare. And now all of a sudden it means\ngrowth is uh expectations are declining.\nThat's kind of how I read this.\nSo now, uh, Bitcoin down quite\nsubstantially. It'll be very interesting\nto me to see how this plays out\ntomorrow. I actually have a longside\nbet, just a quick trade on Bitcoin that\nI disclosed. I talked to my Rebel\nCapitals Pro members about and it was\nreally all about Bitcoin exceeding this\nkind of uh resistance level right here.\nIt it came out, but then it's coming\nback down. It's testing it again. So,\nwe'll see if this goes down uh a lot\nlower. If it does, I'll probably sell\nthe position. But if it bounces, uh,\nthat's going to be what I'm looking for\nhere with Bitcoin. But on the day, down\nabout a,000 bucks. And I think it's\nreally just a result of the of the court\nruling yesterday, you know, bye bye bye\nbye bye. in the court ruling today,\nthis, oh, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell\nsell, because it's possible that the\ntariffs could be back on the table,\nwhich for most, I mean, you might think\nthose are the greatest things since\nsliced bread. And that's fine, but you\ngot to look at it through the lens of\nthe market. And the market thinks that\nthat would slow down\ngrowth. A gold up kind of in a range.\nYou know, gold always does this. It kind\nof seems like it goes way up and then it\nconsolidates for a while, then it shoots\nup and then consolidates for a while.\nSo, it seems like we're in kind of a\nconsolidation pattern right now. And\nwhatever the next big round of\nuncertainty is might move gold to the\nupside. We'll have to wait and see. But\num every single guy that I know that's\ninto technical analysis like Patrick\nSzna as an example um especially if it\nbreaks higher here uh just like that\nBitcoin chart we saw that would be\nextremely bullish for gold and I'm just\ntalking about trading. I'm not talking\nabout long-term stuff the portfolio at\nleast my\nportfolio. And then oil is a big one.\nYeah. Yeah. Shoot. see demand concerns\nthat this is kind of oil is the truth\nserum regardless of what's happening\nwith Trump and the media and the tariffs\nand everyone's speculating on finit and\nare we going to have inflation or\ndeflation or\nrecession oil seems to be just telling\nyou that we might not be headed for a\nrecession but we're probably not headed\nfor an extreme round of GDP growth\nSo kind of like a a a stagnant economy,\nstagnation, if you will. This is telling\nyou\nthat, you know, even if you don't get\nthat recession, that to have economic\ngrowth accelerating in the future is is\nprobably a low\nprobability. And on that note, we know\nthat\nuh let me actually\nWell, my computer's about ready\nto tap out. Josh, if my computer taps\nout here, because my battery is super\nlow, just go ahead and end the stream. I\njust wanted to talk quickly about what\nthe Fed is doing in regard to these\ntariffs. And that is\num see right here in the Wall Street\nJournal. So, this is from this morning.\nFed stays cautious amid stagflation\nfears. Now, the what I wanted to point\nout here, and I did a Substack this\nmorning on this topic, and if you guys\naren't subscribed to the Substack, we do\none almost every single day. I don't\nknow if I've ever even talked about that\non this channel. We just started it. So,\nyou can go to Substack and look at uh\nRebel Capitalist and you can go ahead\nand subscribe for free. Um, this helps\nus kind of build the email list. And a\nlot of it I just do like a topic and\nthen I'll have AI write it and then I'll\napprove it and kind of make sure it it's\nsomething that uh that looks good.\nThat's kind of how we do it. So whenever\nyou see from the Rebel Capitalist news\ndesk, uh that's written by AI, but it's\nwritten by AI with with me at the wheel,\nso to speak.\nUh so anyway,\nuh we talked about this on the Substack\nthis morning, so you can check that out.\nBut the punchline\nhere is why are they worried about\nstagflation? I I I just don't get this\nbecause let's assume for a moment that\nand their argument is, well, if the the\ntariffs come to fruition, uh then they\ncan raise prices. Therefore, we have to\nkeep interest rates where they are, at\nleast the Fed funds rate. And this makes\nno sense to me whatsoever because let's\njust assume that this is just like a\nsales tax, right? So if you put a 10%\nsales tax on XYZ\ngood, you would expect for the uh price\nof whatever item you were buying to go\nup by 10%. Right? because the producer\nof that good or service is not going to\nchange their price or it's very uh\nunlikely they change their price and\nthey just tack on 10%. Okay, but if we\njust had like a 10% sales tax\nimplemented in the United States just\nacross the board, let's assume that we\ndid\nthat. Would would people assume that\nthat's going to lead to consumer price\ninflation? No, of course not. You would\nsay, well, that's going to be a price\nadjustment. prices will go higher, but\nonce you make that price\nadjustment, then they're not going to\ncontinue to go up and up and up and up\nand up just as a result of that sales\ntax. This doesn't make any sense. And by\nthe way, let's just assume for a moment\nthat uh the Fed was looking at this\nsales tax, which is basically what these\ntariffs are. Looking at a sales tax and\nsaying, \"Oh, we're not going to hike or\nwe're not going to drop rates, although\nthe economy is slowing and the data is\ngetting weaker and weaker and weaker.\" I\nthink the initial claims are up to\n240,000 today, by the way.\nBut the Fed's like, \"Oh, we're not going\nto go ahead and drop rates because we\nknow the government's going to implement\nthis sales tax of 10% and that's going\nto increase the price of goods and\nservices across the board by 10%. And\ntherefore, we're not going to drop rates\nalthough the economy is\nslowing.\" That doesn't that doesn't make\nany sense. So what they're implying is\nbecause of these tariffs or just a sales\ntax that prices are going to go up by\n10% but then they're going to go up by\nanother 5% then another 10% another 15\nthen they're just going to go higher and\nhigher and higher and higher and higher.\nNow that may be due to supply shocks or\ndue to uh you know increase of money\nsupply but it's not going to happen just\nbecause you put a tax on it right and if\nanything like let's just assume for a\nmoment I said okay let's put 100% tax\nsales tax forget the tariffs just a\nsales tax domestic sales tax on\neverything would you say would happen to\neconomic activity you'd say well George\nit's going to slow down because people\ncan't afford the higher prices exactly\nexactly Exactly. So prices go up, but\nthen they kind of come back down because\npeople's incomes don't go up to the same\ndegree and therefore you decrease\naggregate demand. So in that\nenvironment, do you think the Fed would\nwould pause? Do you think the Fed would\nbe hawkish? Of course not. They'd be\ncutting rates to compensate for the lack\nof aggregate\ndemand. So I don't know why it's any\ndifferent right here. It just it's very\nbizarre to me. And I I think it actually\nsupports the idea, the notion\nthat if Trump wasn't, let's just say if\nPal liked Trump, maybe he'd be playing\nthis a different way. Maybe, maybe not.\nBut I think there's I don't know if I'd\nagree with that, but I think there's a\ngood argument there because I just don't\nknow other than they're just kind of\nonce bitten, twice shy. That could be it\nwhere you know back in 2020 uh 2021 it\nwas all about inflation transitory\ntransitory transitory and they look like\na bunch of\njackasses. So now they want to keep\nrates hawkish um and air on the side of\ncrushing the economy even though they\ndon't really need to because they don't\nwant to be put into that position where\nthey let inflation run away from them\nbecause the bad rap they got rightfully\nso back in\n2021. And I've said this uh quite often\nthat from Pal's standpoint, it's like\nlook, if he creates a recession by\nkeeping interest rates high, I don't\nthink he would create it, but exacerbate\na recession for him, that's a win as\nlong as inflation comes down, right? So,\nso the only and then if inflation comes\ndown and the economy doesn't go into\nrec, well, that's a win, too. So, the\nonly way he can not win is if inflation\nstarts to accelerate again. So,\nobviously, he's going to air on that\nside.\neven if it's not the right\ndecision. So I I think that's what this\nhawkish tone is about. The last thing I\nwould leave you with is don't just think\nabout this through the lens of the\ncentral bank in the United States. Think\nabout what all the other central banks\nare doing. And the bottom line is all\nthese other central banks, they're\ndropping rates. I believe South Korea\njust came out today and dropped rates.\nUm New Zealand dropping rates. Australia\ndropping rates. Canada obviously\ndropping rates, uh, the ECB dropping\nrates. I mean, this is I don't know how\nlong the United States can be an\noutlier. Now, maybe they can, but if you\nlook at history going back 30, 40, 50\nyears, the the the global economy is so\ninterconnected that it's very very rare\nto have, you know, half the developed\nworld central banks cutting and then the\nother half pausing or going the opposite\ndirection. Us usually they're all\nworking pretty much in unison. So the\nquestion becomes if this\ncontinues is the Fed going to join the\nother central banks in cutting more\nrapidly or are the other central banks\ngoing to join the Fed in being more\nhawkish? And I I my base case would be\nthe Fed is going to join the party of\npeople central banks are actually\ncutting rates a lot quicker than the\nmarket predicts.\nWe'll have to see how it plays out. All\nright, guys. Enjoy the rest of your\nafternoon. As always, make sure you're\nstanding up for freedom, liberty, free\nmarket, capitalism, and we'll see you in\nthe next video."

      "content": "Hello fellow Rebel Capitals. Hope you're\nwell.\nGold really going up today. So, this\nbegs the question, should you\nbuy, hold, or\nsell? I think I'm going to give you an\nanswer that you're not expecting right\nnow on this video. But before we get\ninto that answer and my prediction and\nwhat I'm doing with my own portfolio and\nwhat I'm putting on the watch list as a\nresult of gold doing what it's doing. Uh\nbefore we get into that, let's go over\nto the details to see what's happening\nwith the price action and look at a\ncouple charts here. We got the screen\nshare going. Let's go over to\nCNBC. And gold is up almost 3% today.\nLet me refresh this.\nCome on. Come on. Come on. Okay, we'll\nassume that is refreshed. And let's zoom\nout. Well, thanks CNBC. That took a\nwhile. And what you'll notice with gold,\nand I talked to Patrick Serezna about\nthis the other day, is it likes to\nconsolidate, go way up, consolidate, go\nway up, consolidate, go way up. At least\nwhen it's in a bull market, which\nobviously obviously it has been. When we\ngo back to this chart, we see that it\nwas boy, it I I almost forgot how low it\nwas back in\neven even the end of 2022. So Q4 2022,\nit was at\n1,600,650.\nMan,\nthat that is a bull\nmove for sure. And thank goodness I had\na lot of gold. That was kind of the\nthat's as you guys know that's the\npillar of my portfolios regardless of\nwhat the objectives are for each\nportfolio. But although gold now let's\nzoom\nin go to a threemonth and although gold\nhas gone way up and it was up big today\nyou know like I said almost 3%.\nWe can see that it's kind of in this\nconsolidation type of mode and churning\na bit at least for the last six\nweeks. So right\nnow I would not be a buyer of more\ngold. It doesn't mean I'd\nsell, but there is something that I\nwould definitely definitely consider\nbuying. Now this is not investment\nadvice. This is just what I'm\nconsidering for my own portfolio. I want\nto be crystal\nclear. Let's go over to a\nchart of this\none, the\nGDXJ, the Junior Miners ETF. Most of you\nknow this one. And before we get into\nthis chart, I want to share with you a\nstory from an interview I did today with\nmy good buddy Hugh Henry.\nAnd Hugh was talking about what he\nlikes as far as uh what's on his watch\nlist, let's say, within his uh portfolio\nusing his investing framework, which is\nvery interesting.\nAnd you know, Hugh is very difficult to\nfollow his his train of\nthought. But if you\ndo, you can extract some incredible\ninsights because he has a way of looking\nat the world that is obviously very\nunique. I mean, you can tell that by\nlooking at\nHugh. So, I strongly encourage you guys\nto watch that video, that interview. We\nshould post it up on the Rebel Capitals\ninterviews channel tonight. But one of\nthe things that he was talking about as\na hedge fund manager, he always liked to\nsee things coil. That was the word he\nused. And what he was referring to\nspecifically is\nlong-term kind of basing\neffects within a stock or an asset. and\nthen to see all of a sudden something\nhappen to where it breaks out of that\nconsolidation or that turn, that\nbottoming effect, whatever you want to\ncall it. And what was interesting is we\ndid not talk about the GD XJ today, but\nI just went on to a chart actually prior\nto doing this video because I wanted to\ntalk about gold today because of the big\nmove. And I kind of started with a this\nis an all-time chart going back to 2010\nas you can see. But if we go to like a\none-year chart, look at that. Look at\nthat\ncandlestick. You see, we have this\nresistance level. And Hugh was talking\nabout the longer the res the longer\nyou've had that resistance level, the\nlonger you've had\nthat bottoming out, that basing effect.\nusually in his experience or often when\nyou see a big break above that\nresistance, the longer it's\ncoiled, the bigger the the spring up is\ngoing to be. And I'm sure you guys know\nthat usually you have the gold moves\nfirst, the minors, the the the majors\nmove next, and then the juniors usually\nmove last. But when the juniors move,\nthey usually move to a much more\nsignificant degree in terms of\npercentage than the medal itself. And\nso knowing that and then listening to\nHugh saying that this was one of the\nthings that he always looked for when he\nwas running his hedge\nfund. And then to actually look at this\nchart. I don't know if I've ever seen a\nchart\nthat looks more like what Hugh was\ndescribing in the interview that we did\ntoday. So you start here. This is what\ncaught my attention because you've got\nthis, let's just say resistance right\naround nh 66 67 and then today you've\ngot this big move, good looking\ncandlestick. you know, we closed the day\nalmost at the highs. So, you I don't\nknow if we have a pullback. I I don't\nknow what happens over the next two\nweeks. I just know that over the next 6\nmonths or the next year, and it doesn't\nhappen all the time, but very often this\nis very bullish. So, so now let's go\nback to looks like April. So, you can\nsee we had the same type of a little bit\nof uh resistance here. And then you can\nsee that gap up. This would be good. But\nthen it goes up up up up up up up up up\nup up up up up up up up up up up up up\nup up up up up up up up up up up up up\nup up up up up up up up up and then kind\nof down and back and down and back and\nkind of churn a little bit and then we\nhave another boom big move up here. So\nthis is I'm not a good enough trade. I\nmean I'm terrible at trading. So don't\nlisten to me about the short-term stuff,\nbut I know that this is a very\ninteresting chart and it's one that you\nshould definitely be paying attention\nto, especially if you like gold. because\nyou know the problem with my portfolios\nright now is I actually have too much\ngold as a percentage. So I would like to\nbecause you know I started with 10 15%\nin each of the portfolios and it's gone\nup so much in price that's now it's a\nbigger percentage of the overall\nportfolio. So, what I'm thinking about\ndoing, and again, this is not investment\nadvice, just what I'm considering, is\nselling some of my\ngold, parlaying that into the\nGDXJ. But what gets really exciting,\nthis is what caught my attention. But\nwhen we zoom back out to that alltime\nchart, look at the I mean, this isn't\njust a basing pattern. This is where\nit's done\nnothing\nfor call it since\n2013. I mean\n2013 you're at\n66. So if you would have bought in\n2013 and just\nheld you would have got your ass handed\nto you in real terms because in nominal\nterms, okay, fine, you're even. But\nobviously we've had some significant\nconsumer price inflation. So in real\nterms, you'd be losing purchasing power\non that bet. But let's just focus on the\nnominal stuff. So you're pretty much\nflat since\n2013 up to\ntoday. And then we had\nthis kind of high right\naround about 55 or so right there. And\nthen you get this right around 66 looks\nlike\nhigh and then down again and it keeps\ngoing. Now to be\nclear, both of these would have been a\nbuy signal based on what Hugh was\ntalking about today. So let's just\nassume that we go back in time to May of\n2016. If we would have seen this, you\ncould have made the exact same argument\nthat, oh, look at this. You know, it\ncame down, it had this bottoming pattern\nand then it jumps up over\nthis resistance line and that's good.\nAnd if you would have bought there and\nnot had the risk management to go ahead\nand sell when you were proven wrong, you\nwould have, you know, done nothing. And\nsame thing here. So, we've got to keep\nthat in mind. So, what that means is\nthat if I do buy this, I'm going to put\na very tight stop on it. And if it uh\nlet's just say I buy it at 69. Let's say\nwe have a little bit of pullback\ntomorrow and I buy. If I buy it at 69,\num I'm gonna make sure that, you know, I\ndon't know the exact number, but uh I'm\ngoing to cap my downside at like 60 or\nso, you know, maybe even higher just to\nmake sure I don't buy here and it turns\ninto another one of these or another one\nof\nthese. Now, keep in mind that let's do\nthis actually. Now, let's compare what\nwas happening to the price of gold back\nhere. And I'll bet you we're going to\nsee a much much different story. So,\njust so we can get a good chart, let's\nlook at the GLD and just use as a proxy\nfor gold because I know that's going to\nbe a good chart on Trading View or on\nCNBC. The charts aren't very\ngood because I want to compare time\nframes here. Let's go over to\ncandlestick. Let's go back to all\ntime. Yeah. See, this is where it's\ndifferent. And this is making me even\nmore bullish quite frankly guys because\ngold, you know, those\nother times in the past uh where you had\nwhat could have been perceived as a\nbreakout back in 2016, June and\nin call it June of 2020.\nLet's see what gold was doing back then\nwhen the chart pattern for GDXJ looks\nsimilar to what it looks like today.\nI'll bet you gold is doing something a\nlot different. So the first one was uh\nwhat was that 2015\n16. So it's pretty much down or flat.\nIt's definitely not doing this right.\nAnd then in\n2020, I mean, it's going up a little\nbit, but my point is now you've got this\nhuge move, big huge bull move in\ngold, and you don't really have the same\nmove, not not even close\nin GDXJ. J the\njuniors. And\nso I guess another way to say it\nis back I keep bouncing back here. This\nwas not the juniors or the miners\ncatching up with gold. This was not the\nminers catching up with gold. If\nanything, this was a bigger move than\ngold\nitself. But now I think you could make a\nstrong, very strong argument. This is\nthis move is has a lot higher\nprobability of panning out to the upside\ndue to the fact that gold now has had\nthis big you I'm kind of using my arrow\nas an example has had this big bull move\nand now the miners are just starting to\ncatch up. there's a big delta, let's say\nhere, big spread where back here and\nback here there wasn't that big spread\nbetween the move in gold and the move in\nthe\njuniors. So, this is really exciting and\nit's just really neat to have the\nopportunity to talk to Hugh and have him\nwalk through this strategy that he used\nquite successfully for his hedge fund\nand then just stumble upon this chart\nwith GDXJ and see and see and see not\nonly is it breaking out but it's\nbreaking out of\na 12year\nrange. And remember what Hugh said, the\nlonger the it's it's\nconsolidated, let's say, the usually the\ntighter the coil is\nwound and the bigger bang you'll get\nwhen that spring actually jumps and you\nknow to the to the upside there.\nSo, who know? I\nmean, obviously risk management's\nparamount here. I'm going to put a a\nstop in like I said at maybe 65 if I put\non the put on the or maybe a little\nlower. How would you represent the\ntrade? Would you do call options or just\ngo long stock? No, no, no. I'd go long\nthe GDXJ. I just I just call options you\nyou\nyou introduce variables that I think are\nunnecessary because usually the move in\nthese miners is is just massive. So why\nyou don't really need leverage. I I\nwouldn't personally deal with any of\nthat stuff. I would just buy the GDXJ.\nNow, if you're really good, like Chris\nMacintosh or Lyn Alden or like a pro,\nobviously you can select certain\ncompanies within the GDXJ that will\nprobably\noutperform, but I'm just I I a I'm not\ngood enough at analyzing the balance\nsheets and I've no clue what makes a\ngood minor or a bad minor and I just\ndon't have time. So, for me, it's all\nabout this. But this is a\nreally, really interesting\nchart. Now, let's go back to gold\nbecause I want to mention something that\nI recently stumbled across and I've been\nusing to store um not all, but a portion\nof the gold I have. And this is Monetary\nMetals. Now, you guys know that they've\nbeen a sponsor of the channel for a\ncouple months, and I know Keith really\nwell. he's he's the owner. And uh so I\nset up an account there just to see how\nit would go because before I pitched it\non the channel, I I wanted to make sure\nthat I had an account. I had gone\nthrough the whole buying experience or\nthe whole experience of setting up\naccount, the customer service, you know,\nyou just want to make I was very\nconfident in pitching something that\nKeith was a part of because I know him\nwell. But I just wanted to to go through\nit myself before I started talking about\non the channel. I've been very happy,\nextremely happy. And the neat thing\nabout monetary metals is usually with\nphysical you got to pay to store it. But\nhere you can actually store your gold\nwith them and you can get a return. You\ncan get an interest rate but the\ninterest rate is actually paid in gold.\nNow a lot of people don't understand the\nbusiness model and I see in the chat you\nknow when I talk about monetary metals\nlike oh this has to be a Ponzi scheme or\nyou know this can't be real or it's too\ngood to be true. And I would challenge\nyou to watch the video that we have in\nthe description. Josh will put the link.\nI did a whiteboard video actually on\ntheir business model and go through that\nand and once you understand the business\nmodel, you'll be like, \"Oh, okay. I get\nit. I get it.\" And it's all about\nleasing gold. And it's usually to like a\njeweler or something like that that's\ntrying to hedge their uh their gold\nexposure, right? because with with the\nthe gold that's in the jewelry that they\nhave in in stock, right? Because if they\nhave a lot of gold in the form of\njewelry in in their uh on their shelves\nthat they're selling, if the price goes\nway up or way down, they can be exposed\nto that. And they don't want to have\nthat exposure. They just want to simply\nhave, you know, if if I buy it or if I\nif I created the gold necklace for this\nmuch and sell it for this much, I'm\ntotally cool with that 30% upside. I\ndon't want to take any price risk for\ngold itself. So, that's usually when uh\na jeweler will call Keith and say, \"Hey,\nI want to do one of your gold lease\nprograms.\" And then that that's how it\nkind of works. And then they do it for\nmaybe six months or a year. And then the\njeweler often just kind of rolls it over\nbecause it it makes sense for them\nbecause they're just hedging their\ninventory and they're happy to pay a\nthree or four or 5% interest rate paid\nin gold to have the opportunity to\nhedge. But um if you've ever thought of\nif you've got some physical gold and\nyou're sick and tired of paying to store\nit and you thought, \"Well, boy, that\nwould be nice if I could actually get an\ninterest rate on it like we used to be\nable to get in a bank account.\" Uh, but\nthe super cool thing is that interest\nrate is not just paid in dollars, but\nit's actually paid in\ngold. And so if you think this is a neat\nidea, which it\nis, then you can check out uh\nmonetary-medals.comgamon. And uh if\nyou're still a little confused about the\nbusiness model or how they're able to\npay you that\nreturn, just give them a call. Just give\nthem a call. And they're really nice\nover there. Tell them George sent you,\nyou heard it on one of my videos, you're\na big fan of the Rebel Capitalist Show,\nand they'll be happy just to walk you\nthrough it to see if it's a good fit.\nAnd uh what you get is I just go here\nand you you you get this online portal\nif you set up an account with them. And\nif I just put in my email and my\npassword here, it gives you um Well, I\ncan just do that real quick here. Josh,\ngo ahead and hide the screen, please.\nYep. Okay. Thanks.\nI just want to show everyone what kind\nof the the online portal looks like if\nthey set up an account. Uh let's see.\nOkay, you can go ahead and share it\nback. Can you see this? Yes. Okay, so\nthis is my account. So, I've got $42,000\nuh worth of gold in there right now. And\nagain, it's not all the gold I have,\njust a portion. I want to see how this\nis working out. And it's working out\nreally well. I've got 27,000 that's\ncommitted to their leasing programs. And\nthen uh 14,000 is kind of committed to\nthe next lease that's available. So, on\nthat I'm getting 4%. On this I'm getting\n3.15. And then you can go through and\nyou can check out the different leases\nthat are available. And like I said,\nit's usually like jewelers, um, few in\nthe states, a lot outside of the United\nStates, but you've got the ability to go\nin there and if you don't like one of\nthem, uh, you can just go ahead and\nclick it off and then you won't\nparticipate in that lease. Um, so it\ngives you a lot of control. Um, and then\nit shows you the amount of interest that\nI made. it looks like in May was\n$162 paid in gold. There you go. And\nthat's what I really need to do is get\nthis 14,000 into the leasing program so\nI can start earning\num the in I don't know if that 4% is on\n14. I I think this 14 is in holding\npattern to go into the leasing program\nand that's what's going to increase my\naverage. But again, that's a question\nfor the customer service folks. This is\nwhat it looks like on the back end. Uh\nit's very straightforward, very easy,\nuserfriendly, and uh if you if you don't\nknow what button to push, just go ahead\nand give them a call.\nSo, I would for those of you and I know\na lot of you watching this video of\ncourse are going to be into gold. Uh\njust go ahead and check it out. Now,\ngetting back to me being super excited\nabout not just gold, but uh more so the\njunior miners. Now, Josh, have you\nlistened to Macintosh? I would love to\ngive people some of the miners that he's\nbeen discussing in his research. Have\nyou paid any attention to that? I don't\nknow what he's buying right now.\nOkay. So, I mean, one thing you could do\nis follow Lyn Alden on Twitter, follow\nChris Macintosh. They're my partners in\nRebel Capitalist Pro. Uh they're the\nones that really get into the\nnitty-gritty as far as which uh juniors\nare the best. But you know what you can\ndo today, guys? Honestly, I would just\ntake the financials for some of these\njuniors and put them into chat GPT and\njust build a GPT. you know, Manis the AI\ncan is one of its specialties is\nanalyzing uh balance sheets and\nfinancials for publicly traded\ncompanies. So, I would try to see if I\ncould leverage AI to go ahead and\nanalyze the uh junior miners miners that\nmaybe were in the\nGDXJ to figure out which ones were the\nbest and then maybe I'd just go in on\nthose just to kind of try to get some\nalpha instead of just taking the the\nbeta. Josh, that's what we should do.\nYeah, I was thinking that's a good idea.\nA good idea.\nAll right. So, on that bombshell, we\ngave you some good actionable uh\ninsights today. You guys enjoy the rest\nof your afternoon. As always, make sure\nyou're standing up for freedom, liberty,\nfree market, capitalism, and we'll see\nyou on the next video."

      "content": "Everybody is trying to figure out if\ninterest rates are going to go up or are\nthey going to go down after liberation\nday they crash. Two in 10ear yields are\non pace to close at lowest yields in 6\nmonths. But then afterwards there's\nstagflationary fears and they skyrocket\nhigher. Does that create a risk?\nAbsolutely. It creates a risk of\ninflation to me. It creates a risk of\nhigher long-term rates. Well, the good\nnews is I have discovered a very\npowerful AI tool that will help you\nbetter determine where interest rates\nare headed throughout the rest of 2025\nand beyond. I'm going to reveal this to\nyou in three simple fast steps. Step\nnumber one, I want to share with you a\nhidden secret about interest rates. And\nthen in the next step, we're going to go\nover that AI tool in more detail. But\nlet's start looking at a chart here\ngoing all the way back to June of 2023\nto today's date. On the left, we go from\nzero up to\n250,000. So this is the ADP payroll\nnumber. So going back to June of 2023,\nright around 150,000 trend is down. We\nhad this big spike up and kind of this\nvolatility. And you can see it looks a\nlittle bit different. But what I did is\ninstead of using these bars, I just used\nthis line to kind of smooth it out.\nGives you a better idea of the overall\ntrend. And then at the end of 2024, we\nsee this big spike up, huge job growth,\nmost likely due to Trump being elected\nin those animal spirits. But since that\ntime, look at the trend. This red\nline, if you couldn't tell, it's going\nstraight down to the point where just\nthe other day the ADP numbers came in at\n37,000. Now, that might sound like a\nlot, but for an economy of 350 million\npeople, that is terrible. And\nexpectations were for\n110,000. So, a huge miss. And the month\nprior was 62,000. And that even got\nrevised down to 60,000. Now, I know a\nlot of you right about now are saying,\n\"Okay, George, well, so what? So, the\nlabor market's deteriorating. What does\nthis have to do with your powerful AI\ntool that will help me better predict\ninterest rates?\" Well, it's all about\nunderstanding what really drives rates\nat the long end of the curve. And to be\nspecific, when I'm talking about\ninterest rates in this video, I'm\nreferring to the 10-year Treasury.\nThat's what most people care about\nbecause that's what really impacts all\nof those interest rates in the real\neconomy, such as mortgages. So, let's go\nover that for a moment here. The main\ndriver at the long end of the curve,\nwhich I say in a lot of my videos, but\nit's worth reiterating, is inflation and\ngrowth expectations. Now, a lot of\npeople think that it's deficits or debt.\nBut editor, go ahead and throw up a\nchart of nominal GDP going back, let's\njust say, as far as we can, maybe 50, 75\nyears. And you can see that when you\nline this up with a chart of the 10-year\nTreasury yield, there's a very strong\ncorrelation. Now, if we throw up a chart\nof the deficits and the debt, let's just\nsay going back to 1980, and then the\n10-year Treasury yield, you see there's\nalmost an inverse relationship. So the\nhigher the debts go, the bigger the\ndeficits get, the lower yields tend to\ngo. And we saw this exact same\nphenomenon play out in Japan. So we have\nto focus on this growth and inflation\nexpectations. And the real key here, the\nreal secret, if you will, is that rates,\ninterest rates don't control the\neconomy. So many people get this\nbackwards. They think that whatever the\ninterest rate is, so if the Fed just\ndrops rates, that means it's going to\nstimulate the economy and we're in for\ngood times, going to be running on all\neight cylinders. When in reality,\ninterest rates merely reflect what's\nhappening in the real economy or what\nthe market expects will happen in the\nfuture. Now, I'm sure a lot of you are\nsaying, \"Well, what about the Fed,\nGeorge? The Fed is who really controls\ninterest rates.\" And when we look at the\nlong end of the curve, absolutely not.\nSo, as an example, editor, go ahead and\nthrow up a chart of 2024. You guys\nremember September 18th when the Fed\nstarted dropping rates? They dropped by\n50 basis points. And then throughout the\nrest of 2024, they dropped by 100 basis\npoints. Well, what did the 10-year\nTreasury do? Did it go down because the\nFed was dropping rates? No, it did the\ncomplete opposite. It went up by\napproximately 100 basis points during\nthe same time frame. And why did\ninterest rates go up so much when the\nFed was dropping at the front end of the\ncurve? Because inflation and growth\nexpectations were increasing. Another\nmore recent example I would give you is\nfrom CNBC. This article talking about\nhow the ECB is dropping rates because\ntheir inflation numbers are much lower\nthan expected. And if you scroll all the\nway down to the bottom of the article,\nyou'll see it states growth has been\nvery weak even though they have been\ndropping rates to try to quote unquote\nstimulate the economy. So once again,\nthe point here is interest rates are a\nreflection of what's happening in the\neconomy. They do not control what\nhappens in the economy. So this takes us\nright back to the labor market and this\nchart of the ADP payroll numbers. So in\nthe past when you have seen economic\ncontractions which means this is coming\ndown. Therefore you would expect\ninterest rates to do the exact same\nthing. You've seen substantial spikes in\nthe unemployment rate. So the labor\nmarket getting weaker and weaker and\nweaker. And editor go ahead and throw up\na chart of the 10-year Treasury yield\nagain. And I'd like you to zoom in on\nthese economic contractions. When we see\nthe labor market spike, what typically\nhappens to the 10-year Treasury yield,\nit goes down. So, the main takeaway from\nstep number one is if we want to be able\nto better predict where interest rates\nare headed, we have to start by looking\nat it through the lens of growth and\ninflation expectations. And what's going\nto drive growth in inflation\nexpectations to a significant degree is\nthe labor market. So said another way,\njust hyperfocus on the labor market. And\nthis is going to give you most of the\ndata you need. So then the question\nbecomes, okay, George, I get it. It's\nall about the labor market, but the\nlabor market is a lagging indicator. So,\nis there anything else out there that\nwill give me more advanced notice that\nwill tell me what's happening with the\nreal economy, therefore the\nexpectations before we see a big spike\nin the unemployment rate? And I've\nprobably missed the big move in interest\nrates. The good news, the answer is yes.\ntakes us right back to this incredibly\npowerful AI tool I have discovered that\nI'm going to share with you right\nnow. Step number two. Now, let's go into\nthe details of what this tool is, how it\nworks, and what it's telling us about\nthe economy right now, compared to\nanother time in history when the economy\nwas rather volatile, let's say, and\nthat's the GFC 2008. So, first and\nforemost, we've got this tool broken\ndown into leading indicators and then\nconfirming indicators. Now, I also want\nto mention because I know a lot of you\nare probably very tech-savvy. This isn't\nnecessarily an AI tool. It was a tool\nthat was created and indicators that\nwere created using AI. And yours truly\ncreated these indicators using AI. So,\nwhatever you want to call it, this is\ngoing to give you a significant edge in\ndetermining the direction of interest\nrates in 2025 and into the future.\nThat's all that matters. Okay. So we\nstart with these leading indicators and\nhow I came to the conclusion is I first\nand foremost had 20 30 of these let's\nsay indicators and using AI I back\ntested all of them to determine which\nones were the most powerful and which\nones had the most predictive power. So\nright here we've got initial jobless\nclaims, continuing jobless claims.\ntwo-year 10-year Treasury spread, truck\ntransportation jobs, and construction\nemployment. You'll notice a lot of this\nagain revolves around the labor market.\nSo, what I think a lot of you will find\ninteresting is if you compare where we\nare today to where we were in, let's\nsay, May of 2008. You can see the last\ntime I pulled up the data was May of\n2025. I I realize that was a little\nwhile ago, but the concept is still the\nexact same. So, initial claims, in fact,\nthey just came out today in June, June\n5th to be exact. And they were right\naround\n247. So, this has gotten, it's still\nyellow, but it's gotten a little bit\nworse. And what we did here is I just\nused traffic signals to tell you that\nwhen the recession probabilities or the\ncontract, not necessarily recession, but\nwhen the contraction of the economy, in\nother words, growth and inflation\nexpectations were really declining.\nThat's where you see a red. And if\ngrowth and inflation expectations should\nbe increasing, then that's when you're\ngoing to see a green. Obviously, yellow\nright in the middle. So, we would still\nbe at yellow. And going back to 2008,\ndefinitely a red there. In fact, every\nsingle input was red back in May of 2008\nwhere today we've got three yellows, a\nred, and a green. There we go. Now, this\nis construction employment. If we go to\na chart, a Fred chart, you'll see that\nevery single time we get a recession,\nand this is going back to the 1940s, for\nheaven's sakes, almost every single time\nyou see a big dip in construction\nemployment. Now, it is true we had some\nanomalies back in\n1945. It looks like maybe\n1953. But for the most part, especially\nmore recently, if we do get growth and\ninflation expectations going\ndown, economic contraction, recession,\nwhatever you want to call it, you see\nthat it coincides with construction jobs\ngoing down. And right now, they\nflattened out a little bit. They're\ndefinitely not declining. So the main\ntakeaway from the leading indicators is\nif all of these are lining up red,\nthere's a high probability that if the\nunemployment rate hasn't spiked, it's\ngoing to spike in the near future. It's\nnot a matter of if, it's only a matter\nof when. And when that unemployment rate\nspikes, the expectations go down and\ninterest rates would likely come down\nwith it. Now, on the flip side of the\ncoin, if all of these signals or lights\nturn green, then it's the complete\nopposite. We should not expect a spike\nin unemployment. We might see\nunemployment go down even further. And\nin this case, the economy would be\nheating up most likely and you'd see\ninterest rates increase. Now, moving on\nto the confirming indicators and I use\nthe exact same process here. I started\nwith maybe 20 inputs and tried to narrow\nit down as much as I could to get to the\nones that were the most powerful. And\nwhat I want to highlight here is when\nyou see a red flashing signal on these,\nit doesn't necessarily mean you're\nheaded for an economic contraction. It\nmeans you're likely already in one\nregardless of what the NBER is saying.\nSo, we got non-farm payroll growth. We\ngot core CPI, the SOM rule, loans,\nleases, credit card delinquencies,\nmortgage delinquencies, the restaurant\nperformance index. This is something you\ndon't hear people talk about a lot, but\nwhen I back tested it, it was very, very\naccurate. Price of oil and then subprime\nauto delinquencies. So, long story\nshort, back in 2008 May, when we know we\nwere in an economic contraction and\nrates were just about ready to plummet\nat the long end of the curve, we had a\nlittle bit of a mix. We had one, two,\nthree, four, five, six reds and three\nyellows. Where today it's not as bad.\nWe're pretty much the opposite. We've\ngot six yellows and only three reds.\nNow, this doesn't show us that the\neconomy is booming by any stretch of the\nimagination. It's what I call a stuck in\nthe mud economy. You're just not really\ngetting any growth. It's very sluggish.\nThe data is softening. You might tip\ninto a recession, but currently you're\nnot at a point where you would expect to\nsee the unemployment rate skyrocket, and\ntherefore growth and inflation\nexpectations plummet along with interest\nrates. The last one that we're going to\ndiscuss gets a little wonky here, but I\nuse it for a measurement, a true\nmeasurement of liquidity because I don't\nbelieve liquidity comes from the central\nbanks. I think it comes from the\ncommercial banks in the monetary system.\nThey can create as much liquidity as\nthey want. It all depends on the risk\nversus reward. So if we see the banks\ngoing risk off and we see the banks in\ntheir actions telling us they are\npredicting interest rates will be lower\nor higher in the future, we have to\nfactor that into our predictive model.\nSo I'm not going to go over all these\nbecause they get very technical, but the\none I want to focus on and the one that\nyou can focus on is swap spreads. So\nright now they are negative. The bottom\nline, this is a huge, huge red light.\nAnd what this tells you, if the 10-year\nswap spread is negative, as an example,\nthat the market is predicting that over\nthe long run, interest rates will be\nlower than they are today. So, the main\ntakeaway from step number two is if I\ncould just give you three inputs to\nwatch with this AI model I created.\nNumber one would be initial claims.\nNumber two would be non-farm payrolls\nand number three would be swap spreads.\nWhen you see these turn green, you can\nexpect that interest rates will likely\ntrend higher in the future. If it's\nyellow, that basically means that for\nthe foreseeable future, you should\nexpect interest rates to trade within a\ncertain range. And then if it's red,\nthis means that growth and inflation\nexpectations are decreasing. And you\nshould also assume interest rates will\ndo the same thing. But what I want to\nemphasize is there's a lot of noise in\ninterest rates. Nothing goes up or down\nin a straight line. So whether it's red,\nyellow, or green, remember this doesn't\nnecessarily tell you what's going to\nhappen in the next five minutes or\ntomorrow. It really just tells you\nwhat's likely going to be the\ntrend. Step number three. So, now let's\ngo ahead and put everything together to\ngive you some actionable intel you're\nnot going to hear anywhere else. But\nbefore we do, editor, let's cut to check\nout today's sponsor, Monetary Metals.\nThis is a place you can store your gold\nand actually get paid in gold. And if\nyou don't own any gold right now,\nespecially in today's day and age, what\non earth are you doing? So, first and\nforemost, get some\ngold and then check out Monetary Metals.\nEditor, cut to the clip. Hey guys, I\nwanted to take a quick break from the\nvideo to share with you a new investment\nstrategy I've been using. Most of you\nknow the cornerstone for my portfolio is\nphysical gold. The problem is you always\nhave a negative carry because you have\nstorage fees. Same thing with silver.\nBut I've actually found a way that you\ncan be paid to own physical gold and\nsilver. And here's the best part. You're\nnot just paid an interest rate in fiat\ncurrency. You're paid an interest rate\nin more precious metals. Now, I know a\nlot of you are saying, \"Oh, Georgia\nsounds too good to be true.\" And it's\nexactly what I thought when I first\nheard about this. Here's the backstory.\nI get a lot of businesses that come to\nme and say, \"George, we want to sponsor\nyour videos.\" Usually I turn them down\nbecause it's not really a good fit. But\nI had a company come to me the other day\ncalled Monetary Metals. And when they\nwere walking me through what they do in\ntheir business model, I thought to\nmyself, \"This is a complete no-brainer.\"\nIn fact, it sounded so good, I set up an\naccount myself and it's been going\nextremely well. So I said, \"Sure,\nsponsor a couple videos because this is\na service that I think would be hugely\nbeneficial to my audience.\" So here's\nhow it works. You can go ahead and set\nup an account with them and fund it with\nyour existing precious metals or you can\nbuy directly from them, usually a little\nless than 1% over spot. And right now,\nas we speak on the platform, there's\nopportunities to be paid about 4%\ninterest. So again, this is not in fiat\ncurrency. They're paying you in\nadditional precious metals. So if you\ndeposit, let's say 100 ounces of gold\nwith them, at the end of the year you'll\nhave\n104 ounces of gold. So to join the\nthousands of investors, including yours\ntruly, who are being paid to own\nphysical gold and silver, you can go to\nmonetary-medals.comgamin. That's\nmonetary-metals.comgamin.\nNow, let's quickly review what we've\ndiscovered so far in this video. First\nand foremost, interest rates at the long\nend of the curve are really driven by\ngrowth and inflation\nexpectations. Also, after all the AI\npowered research that I've done creating\nthese models and these indicators, the\nmain takeaway for the average Joe and\nJane is to really focus on three main\nindicators. Number one, initial jobless\nclaims. Number two, non-farm payrolls.\nAnd number three, the interest rate swap\nspreads which we know are negative. So\nright now we want to focus on the first\ntwo. And remember the initial claims is\nkind of more of a leading indicator\nwhere the non-farm payrolls more so a\nconfirming indicator. So let's start by\nlooking at a chart here going back to\nJuly 2023. It's about two years on the\nleft. We go from zero up to 500,000.\nThis is the infamous nonfarm payrolls.\nSo just the other day, initial claims\ncame out at 247. I think we mentioned\nthat in step number two. So it wasn't a\nhorrible number, but it wasn't a great\nnumber. And we can see the trend\nstarting to creep higher. This would\ntell us that there's softening in the\nlabor market. And then we got that ADP\nnumber that we went over in step number\none. That was absolutely atrocious. But\nthe market's going to pay more attention\nto what's happening with non-farm\npayroll. Whether that's right or wrong,\nthat's a discussion for another video.\nSo, looking at where we're starting\nhere, July 2023, just under\n250,000. So, these 250,000 jobs added\nfor the month. And then we kind of go up\nand down, but you can see this trend is\nreally going lower until we get to this\npoint where it really skyrockets. What\nhappened here? Well, that was Trump\nwinning the election. So, you have all\nof these animal spirits because everyone\nthinks that Trump is going to be great\nfor business. So, they're hiring all of\nthese employees to handle this massive\namount of demand they think they're\ngoing to get. But then we kind of get\npast that honeymoon phase and then we\nstart talking about tariffs and a lot of\nthese things that lead to uncertainty or\ninstability and we go right back down to\nkind of where we were with this trend\nwhich is lower. So if you had to look at\nthis chart alone and nothing else, what\nwould you say interest rates did on the\n10-year Treasury over the last two\nyears? Editor, you can go ahead and cue\nthe Jeopardy music.\nAh, now let's add one more thing before\nyou give me your final answer. Remember,\nright about here, we had some inflation\nexpectations really go up due to the\ntariffs and also due to the Fed because\neveryone thought the Fed was dropping\nway too quickly relative to the strength\nof the economy. So, we had this whole\nnarrative about how inflation is going\nto skyrocket. So you combine what's\nhappening with the tariffs and the Fed.\nThis would be inflation expectations and\nthis would be a representation of growth\nexpectations. So now go ahead and give\nme your final answer. What do you think\nhappened to interest rates on the\n10-year Treasury? Editor, go ahead and\nthrow up a chart. And you can see that\nthe 10-year Treasury yields did probably\nwhat most of you expected they should\nhave during this time frame as they went\nup slightly. So the key moving forward\nis to really focus on what you think is\ngoing to happen with\nexpectations. Now, if we see initial\nclaims start to go down and we see the\nnon-farm payroll numbers start to\nincrease, well, this is giving you a\ngood idea that all else being equal, you\nshould expect interest rates to start\ngoing up. But assuming that the\ninflation expectations are pretty much\nflat, if you start to see those initial\nclaims really start to skyrocket, so go\nup to 300, 350,000 as an example, and\nthen you see the non-farm payrolls start\ngetting closer and closer to zero, even\nnegative, then you know that interest\nrates are likely going to follow. And\nlet's assume the 10ear treasures at 4.4\nright now. If you start to see the\nlatter, initial claims and non-farm\npayrolls deteriorating, you should see\nthe 10-year Treasury going down probably\nsouth of 4%.

      "content": "Hello fellow robo capitalists. Hope you\nare well. Boy oh boy, we got a lot to\ntalk about. It is the Jerry Springer\nshow in Washington DC or in Camp MAGA as\nwe might say. What is happening? Some of\nyou are probably asking. I'm glad you\nasked. Well, Elon Musk just accused\nTrump of being in the Epstein files. for\nstarters. Oh boy, it is. There you go.\nSteo says, \"It's just like watching\nWWF.\" Oh my gosh, it is. Th This is\ntotal I mean, it's so entertaining, but\nman, it's pathetic, isn't it? Sad that\nour politics and our our our leaders in\nthe United States, if you will, have\ndevolved to this level. But let's get\nright into the nitty-gritty here. And\nthen more importantly, let's discuss how\nthis could impact the United States\neconomy. Josh, go ahead and throw up my\nTwitter feed. I've been posting as I've\nseen. Can you blow that up, buddy? We're\njust Can you increase? Well, that's\nokay. Actually, you know what, Josh?\nPull up mine. I think it's easier if I\njust go over to this. Uh I'm on your\nyours right now. Yeah. So that's\nbasically what's happening in Camp Trump\nright now or in\nMAGA. And I posted this and this is\nbefore Musk came out and accused Trump\nof being in the Epstein\nfiles. And I mean there's so much psych\nuh psychology going on here with and I'm\nnot saying that everyone in the MAGA\ncamp was just kind of saw Trump as like\na cult-like figure, but there was a lot\nof people that did. And no matter what\nTrump did, it was 5D chess. It was art\nof the deal. He's just way ahead of\neveryone else. And no matter what he\nsays, we've got to get behind him. You\nknow, principles be damned. And but it\nwas the same thing for Musk, right? He's\npart of Doge and he wants to reduce the\ndeficits and all the things that the\nsound money guys and gals talk about. We\nwant to reduce government spending and\nall these things. And now they're on the\nsame team and this is just incredible.\nIt's a match made in heaven. And then\nthe honeymoon not only ends, it comes to\na tragic\nend. And the divorce, holy cow, it\nescalated quickly, didn't it? It went\nfrom them being good buddies, like BFFs,\nright? Like bro BFFs to all of a sudden\nnow they're just really slinging the\nmud. So, you know, earlier in the day it\nwas just Josh, I'm going to shoot over\nto uh this is a little easier. Can you\nsee\nthis? Can you see this now, Josh? Yeah,\nwe can see it. Okay. So earlier in the\nday or\nyesterday, it started with the whole big\nbeautiful bill and Trump puts this out\nthere. everyone needs to uh to pass it.\nAnd then he basically talked smack about\nuh Rand Paul coming out and I'm sure\nThomas Massie probably came out as well\nand Trump is verbally attacking him. And\nyou know that's okay for the the MAGA\ncrowd until Musk comes out and says\nbasically I can't bite my tongue\nanymore. This bill is an abomination.\nAnd then he really goes nuts and starts\nsaying that or really just kind of\nderails really starts ranting and goes\non saying how every single person with\ngood conscience, every single political\nperson, you know, politician needs to uh\nvote this bill down. This needs to never\never pass. And then he starts putting\nout these memes talking about kill the\nbill. Remember the movie Kill Bill? Uh\nit's kill the bill, right? And so it\njust keeps going just and then Trump\nresponds by saying that uh you know Elon\nMusk is has gone crazy and now maybe we\nshould take away all of the the\ncontracts the political contracts that\nwe have and then Elon just keeps\nescalating and escalating and\nescalating. So, here we go. And now\nwe're at the point right now, I didn't\neven know this, that the Democrats,\nwell, this is Yeah, everyone's attacking\nMus now. They're accusing him of doing\ndrugs and they're investigating alleged\ndrug use. I'm sure Trump is going to\npiggyback on this. You know, it's going\nto get to the point, or it could, where\nthe MAGA crowd is lighting Teslas on\nfire and the Democrats are lighting\nTeslas. Everybody's lighting Teslas on\nfire.\nAh, I wonder what Zero Head is going to\ndo then because they were so hard on the\npeople that were lighting them on fire\nas they should have been. But when the\nMAGA people start lighting them on fire,\nI wonder\nhow they're they're going to spin that.\nAnyway, here we go. Uh, ex piloting new\nprogram. Okay. Yeah, fine. Um, Musk\nfloats a new party. So, a new political\nparty. And then on his Twitter feed,\nMusk was talking, I think he did a poll\nas to who people thought would win an\nelection, him or Trump. And then people\nare saying Musk. And he's like, \"Yeah,\nI'd win easily.\" You know, he's\nbasically, I'm paraphrasing here, but\nthis is what's happening on social media\nwith their feeds. And it's not just in\nthe mainstream media. So it's not that\nthe mainstream media is spinning this at\nall. Just go to their feeds and you're\ngoing to see exactly what's going on.\nSo, here's where Trump threatens to\ncancel Musk's government\ncontracts. Then Musk says, you know,\nfires back at Trump saying, \"Without me,\nTrump would have lost the\nelection.\" That's pretty\nsevere. And then more\nrecently, now Josh, can you go up to\nElon Musk's Twitter feed?\nbecause more as soon as go to Musk's\nTwitter\nfeed. So there's let's see he's got the\npoll. Is it time to start a new party? I\nkeep scrolling down. In 1992, Trump\npartied with\nEpstein. I'm just going to leave this\nhere. And Elon Musk has got the what's\ngoing on here. Keep going\ndown. the Trump tariffs will c Oh, now\nhe's going after the tariffs. I haven't\neven seen this one. Wow. Okay, because\nboy oh boy, the tariffs are kind of the\nthe sacred cow for MAGA. You can't go\nyou can't talk anything bad about the\ntariffs. Eli, in fact, I think that the\nthe MAGA types would prefer you accuse\nTrump of being in the Epstein files as\nopposed to talking smack about the\ntariffs. I I don't know. Who knows? I'm\njust spitballing it. But this is really\ngetting serious once you start talking\nabout the tariffs. The And what did he\nsay specifically? The Trump tariffs will\ncause a recession in the second half of\nthis year. Can I finally say Trump\ntariffs are super stupid? Okay, keep\nscrolling\ndown. Okay, keep scrolling down. And\nBill goes, \"Well, you know, Mike, talk\nto Okay, and then uh Okay. Oh, now he\nnow this is where he's posting more\nstuff about Epstein. I haven't even seen\nthis.\" And he being uh Musk. Keep going\ndown,\nJosh. President versus Elon. Who wins?\nMy money is on Elon. Trump should be\nimpeached and JD Vance should replace\nhim. Elon Musk responds,\n\"Yes.\" Oh jeez. Now keep going because\nMusk fires back at\nTrump. Um, in light of President Oh, no.\nNo. Right there. In light of president's\nstatement about cancellation of my\ngovernment contracts, Space X will begin\ndecommissioning its Dragon spacecraft\nimmediately. So, they are attacking each\nother on all fronts. They're attacking\neach other as far as the leverage they\nhave. Donald Trump with the the\ngovernment purse purse strings and Elon\nwith, you know, the leverage that he has\nover the governments based on the goods\nand services he's providing. Uh they're\nattacking each other politically and\nthey're attacking each other personally\nas well. Do you think liberals are going\nto go back to loving Musk like they used\nto from the green energy now that he\nhates Trump?\nThat's a good question. I mean, it'll be\nfascinating to see how this plays out\nfrom a psychological standpoint because\nthere were so many in the the the MAGA\ncamp where Trump and Musk could just do\nno wrong. I mean, but both of them just\nwalk on water and anything they did, you\nhad kind of this mental gymnastics as to\njustifying it or or rationalizing why\nthis was the best thing to do. And I'm\nnot saying everyone is like that, but\nyou guys know what I'm talking just just\nlooking at this objectively. There are a\nlot of people that follow Trump and Musk\nthat are like that. You know, both of\nthem are kind of these cult of\npersonalities. And so when the two now\nclash, it's like what happens? Does does\nthis go does do we get to the point\nwhere there's two different uh factions\nof MAGA? One is Musk and one is the\nTrump version and then they hate each\nother. I I've I have no idea no idea how\nthis plays out. But the bottom line is\nit's definitely going to if this\ncontinues, it's definitely going to have\nan impact on the economy and especially\non these negotiations with the tariffs.\nI mean, look, if I'm Xi Jinping, put\nyourself in his position and you see\nthis coming across the news. I I mean,\nyou've got to be laughing. You've got to\nbe just saying to yourself, this is a\njoke. I mean, I'm just dealing with\ninfants here. There's no adults that I'm\nnegotiating with, and I'm not saying\nthat that's correct, but if you're Xi\nJinping, aren't isn't that going through\nyour mind?\nI mean, this is Yeah, this is bread and\ncircuses. No pro. No kidding. Th this\nis latestage empire right here. For\nsure. For sure. But now, let's think\nabout this in terms of the uncertainty.\nAnd I I hate to use that word because uh\nit's getting so played out, but it's\ntrue that the markets and the economy,\nthey like stability. They like knowing\nwhat the rules are going to be in six\nmonths. And I'm not saying that, you\nknow, changing the rules all the time or\nkind of this haphazard approach isn't\ngood for the United States long term as\nfar as negotiating deals. Maybe it is.\nMaybe it is. And maybe you got to break\na few eggs to make an omelette. But the\nbottom line is in the short term it\ncauses severe\ndisruptions. So, and that's just what's\ngoing on as far as the trade\nnegotiations now that you've got this\ninfighting to say the least. I mean,\nit's it's not like Elon is just saying,\n\"Oh, I don't like the big beautiful\nbill.\" It's not like he's coming out and\njust saying, \"I love Trump, but I don't\nreally like this bill, and I probably\nwouldn't vote for it.\" And then Trump\ncomes back and says, \"Well, Elon and I\nare still buddies, but we can agree to\ndisagree on this.\"\nThat's not what's happening here. I\nmean, they are really going at each\nother like you would expect like sworn\nenemies to do. It's just incredible how\nthey can go from zero, how they can go\nfrom from bro\nBFFs to just going at each other's\nthroat within the matter of 48 hours. So\nthen you've got to ask,\nokay, what does this do for the economy?\nI mean, I was listening to a podcast\nwith my good buddy Adam Tagert today\nwhere he was interviewing the gal that's\nin charge of the University of Michigan\nsurvey and she was talking about\nconsumer sentiment. I mean, we've all\nfollowed that, right? But it heavily\nskews Democrat as far as they see things\nmuch more negatively. Although more\nrecently, Republicans have started to\nsee the economy and the employment\npicture negatively as well, but just not\nas severely negative as the\nDemocrats. And so they were talking\nabout, you know, how everyone is pulling\nback right now. Corporations are pulling\nback, the consumer is pulling back\nbecause of this lack of stability where\nthey just don't know what's going to\nhappen next. And I don't know how this\nwould wouldn't add to it. I mean, think\nabout it. If you're a business owner and\nyou're, you know, in the the the MAGA\ncamp, what you're looking at this and\nare you sitting there saying to\nyourself, \"Oh, wow. This makes me feel\ngreat about the potential of the\neconomy. I'm going to go out there and\nhire a bunch of workers today.\" No.\nbecause everything that you base your\nworldview on, not not I'm I'm being a\nlittle dramatic here, but I'm just to\nkind of illustrate the\npoint, your your your worldview right\nnow and who you believe to be the good\nguys, I mean, that's crumbling right\nnow. And you you've got to take a\nposition here as to, okay, now who's the\ngood guy? because I thought both these\nguys were good guys, but now they can't\nboth be good guys because now they're\ngoing after each other and saying that\nthis guy's a bad guy and that guy's a\nbad guy. So, who am I going to choose?\nAnd if I choose one of them, then does\nthat mean that my worldview that I've\nhad over the last few months was\ncompletely\nincorrect? And if it was, then how do I\nreconcile that?\nAnd I don't think you reconcile that by\ngoing out and spending a lot of money or\ndoing a lot of R&D or expanding your\nbusiness or if you're a consumer making\nthat big purchase that you may have been\nconsidering. I think you just step back\nand you're like, \"Whoa, time out here.\nI've got to re-evaluate and I've got to\nget back on solid footing here before I\ndecide what to do next.\" And to Josh's\npoint, you know, what are the Democrats\ndoing right\nnow? They they've got to be loving this.\nThey've got to be If I was the\nDemocrats, I'd just sit back and shut\nup. I'd sit back, shut\nup, and and let the games begin. Uh,\nwow.\nNow, let's get into some hard data\nbecause we talked about kind of this the\nJerry Springer show, if you will, within\nMAGA, but and we talked about how this\ncould impact psychology. Definitely\ndoesn't add to the stability, that's for\nsure. And man, can you imagine if Trump\ndoes if they release the Epstein files\nand Trump is in there? I\nmean, geez. Then what do you do if\nyou're a big supporter of Trump? I I\nmean a lot of people are just going to\nrationalize it and say, \"Oh, that's\nnonsense. It's just, you know, it's\nPhotoshop or it's just AI or Trump would\nnever do that.\" But a a good portion of\nthe MAGA crew will kind of have that\nepiphany moment. I think a lot very um\nsimilar to a lot of the Democrats during\nthe surveys where they tried to mandate\nor they tried to push the medicine,\nlet's say, on small children. And that\nwas kind of the line in the sand for\neven a lot of the Democrats. They said,\n\"No, no, no, no, no, no. Thi this is\nthis is where I\ncompletely go the other direction. This\nis kind of the eye opening moment where\nthe party that I've been a part of for\nso long no longer represents my\nvalues.\" And so again, I'm not saying\nthat Trump is on there. I'm not I'm just\nsaying what if what you know let's fast\nforward two or three months. What if it\ncomes out and then you can imagine a lot\nof of the MAGA group having that moment\nif you will like a lot of the Democrats\ndid during the survea sickness and what\ndoes that do to the Republican party?\nWhat does that do going into midterms?\nSee there's a lot of these questions\nthat we really need to ask. This this\nisn't just Jerry Springer. It it goes uh\nmuch deeper than that. I think. But now,\nlet's get over to some of the data\nthat's coming out around this, we'll\ncall it\nsituation. So, Josh, uh, let's see. We\ngot the screen share going. Can you see\nthis? Yes.\nOkay. And by the way, due to this little\nthis little spat right here, Tesla loses\n152 billion in market cap today just\nbecause of that Twitter back and forth\nbetween him and Trump.\nGeez. Oh my goodness\ngracious. You know, th this is a lesson\nfor investors. I mean, be very, very\ncareful if you're buying these\nhigh-flying stocks where the\nfundamentals really don't justify the\nprice because something like this can\ncome out and they can just plummet in an\ninstant. But headline here, corporate\nlayoffs have ramped\nup in recent weeks. Here are the\ncompanies making the cuts. And before we\ngo into that, I want to go over to this\nmarket watch calendar that we've been\nreally paying close attention to lately\nbecause, as you guys know, I'm really\nfocused on the labor market. And right\nhere, we had initial jobless claims. The\nexpectation was for\n236,000. We're at 247. And if you guys\ndidn't watch the video yesterday, it was\nhow ADP payrolls came in at 37,000 with\nan expectation of\n110. Huge miss. And the month prior was\ndownward downwardly revised to\n60,000. So tomorrow is a big big day\nbecause we get the non-farm payrolls. We\nhad a 177. We see the trend starting to\ngo down very quickly.\nAnd the expectations for 125, we'll have\nto see. I mean, does it exceed does it\nmiss what happens to the unemployment\nrate? I mean, if this goes up to, let's\nsay, 200,000 and we see the unemployment\nrate start to tick up again. I mean,\nthat's that in of itself doesn't mean\nthat we're in a recession. And it\ndoesn't necessarily mean that the\neconomy is contracting, but it means\nthat the\nprobabilities are definitely increasing.\nAnd then you've got to ask\nyourself how much of what we're\nseeing or how much of what we're seeing\nin the economy is a reflection of this\nuncertainty. Regardless of where the\nuncertainty or the instability is\nactually coming from, whether it's\ncoming from Trump trying to negotiate\nwith Xi Jinping or from Elon Musk's\nTwitter feed and the Epstein\nfiles. But getting back to CNBC\ncorporate layoffs, let's check this out.\nKey talking points. Companies are under\nincreasing pressure to trim costs\nagainst the backdrop of global economic\nuncertainty. Okay, we know that many\ncompanies lumped layoffs in with larger\ncost cutting strategies. And I don't Oh,\nhere we go. I was just going to say AI.\nI was just going to say I wonder how\nmuch of this is attributed to AI. And\nthe very next sentence is some have\ncited AI is a factor in headcount\nadjustments. So, you guys know that I've\nbeen pounding the table on this for the\nlast probably couple months that I\nbelieve in the next three to five years,\nwe're going to get UBI because I believe\nthe unemployment rate, let's set aside\nan economic contraction. Let's just go\nahead and shelf a potential recession. I\nthink with even without that the economy\njust staying as it is right now you're\ngoing to see the unemployment rate\ngo six 7%\nuh maybe even higher and that's even if\nwe don't go into a recession as a result\nof these companies just firing people\ndue to AI is it at the point where AI\ncan replace everyone and do no no\nabsolutely not but as far as like\nentrylevel white collar jobs or\nentry-level service stuff where you're\njust interacting with a computer or you\nknow a lot of these virtual jobs where\nyou don't really have to go into the\noffice where you're just kind of working\nfrom home or uh you know wherever you\nfrom many in Colombia. I think those are\nthe first jobs to go, especially the\nentry level. And I don't think\nthat's outrage that's an outrageous\nstatement. If you just think it\nthrough, that's just the reality of the\nsituation that we're going to have to\ngrapple with. And I think long term,\nthis is going to be a huge benefit for\nhumanity, the society, the economy. But\nin the interim, you go\nthrough a lot of chaos getting from A to\nZ.\nAnd anyway, bottom line, I think that\ndue to AI, you're going to see the\nunemployment rate go up to a point where\nthey're not only just going to consider\nUBI, I think they're going to implement\nit. Even Trump, even\nTrump, companies including Walmart,\nAmazon, Microsoft, Proctor Gamble have\nannounced job cuts in recent weeks.\nSo this happens at the time they point\nout when Musk was cutting government\njobs and good on him for doing it. But\nregardless in the short run that\ndefinitely impacts aggregate demand even\nif it's a a government\njob. So Proctor Gamble, let's see what\nthey said. This was on Thursday. It'll\ncut 7,000 jobs.\nWow. Okay. It's I did not know that\n7,000 jobs or 15% of its non-m\nmanufacturing workforce over the next\ntwo years as part of\nrestructuring. And I'm I'm I can almost\nguarantee you that restructuring\nincludes leveraging AI. Microsoft said\nlast month it would would reduce by\nabout 6,000. I wonder if they're going\nto point out IBM. Remember we did a\nvideo on that where IBM is cutting 8,000\njobs and that they directly cited AI in\ntheir\nstatement. Cityroup\nlaying off 3500 that's in China.\nOkay. Walmart planning to slash500 jobs.\nClarina, I'm not sure what they do.\nClarina told employees last month that\nthe Swedish buy now pay Oh, it's buy now\npay later. That's right. That This is\nironic, isn't it? That now the buy now\npay later companies are even laying off\ntheir workforce. Geez, what does that\ntell you about the economy? I mean, we\ngo from, you know, these buy now pay\nlaterers just blowing up. They're doing\nso well because they're so needed. And\nthen you get to the point where the\npeople can't even buy things on buy now\npay later. And then the claras of the\nworld have to start laying people off.\nThey said they're going to slash 10% of\ntheir global\nworkforce. Listen to\nthis. This week before that\nannouncement, he told I'm assuming this\nwas the CEO. He told CNBC that CLA has\nshrunk its workforce by about\n40% due to investments in AI and natural\nattrition.\nAlmost every\nsingle business owner that I talk to has\nthis game plan that they're not outright\nfiring people, but if someone quits,\nthey're not just they're just not hiring\na person to replace them and they're\njust doing everything that they can to\nreplace them with\nAI or with just other people doing their\njob leveraging AI within the\norganization.\nSo, Crowd Strike announced plans to cut\n500 employees, about 5% of its\nstaff. We're operating in a market and\ntechnology inflection point with AI\nreshaping industry. Another one that's\ndirectly citing AI\nlayoffs at Disney doesn't seem like it's\ntoo huge. Che online education firm\nwould laugh 248 about 22% of its work\nforce. The cuts came as AI powered tools\nlike open AI and chat GPT take over\neducation. Yeah. So it's it's not just\nthe fact that AI is taking over jobs but\nAI is just eliminating the need for a\nlot of these huge businesses.\nI mean, it's just like language, right?\nIf you had to learn a language right\nnow, like Spanish, would you just use\nAI? You just build an AI instructor to\ndo it. Why on earth would you pay a\nprivate tutor, a coach, or why would you\npay for, you know, some sort of uh $200\nmembership program or something? I mean,\njust have AI do it for free.\nAmazon has laid off roughly 27,000\nemployees. Okay, that's\nsignificant. But the the and then right\nhere I just before we went live, I saw\nthis Lulule Man shares tumble 20% as it\ncuts fullear guidance citing dynamic\nmacro environment. In other words,\ninstability.\nInstability. And when the leader of the\nfree world, if you will, in Donald Trump\nis basically involved in a a real life\nJerry Springer show with Elon Musk. I I\nI don't think it's going to give them\neven more confidence.\nRegardless of whether you side with Musk\nor Trump on this one, the bottom line is\nthis can't be good if you're in\ncorporate America trying to make\ndecisions right\nnow. And here's uh you know this is kind\nof old news now but it's uh Trump saying\nthat Musk went crazy and suggesting\ncutting government contracts for his\ncompanies. And you know this is where I\nsay that I voted for Trump. You guys\nknow that because I was all about the\nfree speech component of his campaign\nand I was kind of a a oneisssue voter if\nyou will. But I mean you got to admit\nTrump\nhas that authoritarian bent to him that\nif you piss him off, he he's going to\ncome after you.\nUh whether that's good or bad, I'll I'll\nlet you be the judge. But this is part\nfor the course here. Exactly what you\nwould expect from Trump. It's just when\nyou're dealing with Musk, he's he's like\nthe same thing. They're like two peas in\na pod. They're both fantastic\nsalespeople, maybe the best we've ever\nseen. They're both incredibly good at\nsocial media. They're incredibly good at\ntrolling. So, it's like this immovable\nobject with the unstoppable force, but\nthey're very similar. You know, a lot of\ntheir personality. There's like a 90%\noverlap there in their kind of their MO\nand how they handle problems. and they\njust they go right after someone, you\nknow, the personal attacks, everything.\nSo, I don't see this deescalating. Uh,\nunless, you know, probably what's\nhappening behind the scenes here is\nTucker Carlson or someone like that is\nprobably calling both of them and just\ntrying to get a meeting together and\nsaying, \"Guys, this is terrible for the\nmovement. This is terrible for what\nwe're trying to do.\" And I'm sure that\nuh you know maybe in the next couple\nweeks Tucker Carlson has them both on\nhis show to do like a big kumbaya or\nsomething like that. But I guarantee you\na day later they'd be right back at\nit. Ah geez. You just can't make this\nstuff up. You just can't make it up. So\nlet's see how markets\nare. That's weird. Huh. Never seen that\nfrom CNBC.\nWhat the heck is going\non? Are we I I can see it. It's just\nweird. Huh? Thought we lost internet\nthere for a\nsecond. What you Okay, here we go. Here\nwe go. Must have been just a glitch on\ntheir website or something like\nthat. So, markets are are down a little\nbit.\nbonds are up, but I think the majority\nof the Jerry Springer stuff happened\nafter the market closed. Now, what\nyou'll find interesting is if we look at\nthe action on the 10-year Treasury just\ntoday. And once again, this proves\nexactly what I say on this channel that\nit's just all about growth in inflation\nexpectations. It's all about that. Has\nnothing to do with deficits or debts. Uh\nI'm not saying that the deficits and the\ndebts are good. Uh but it's not a\nproblem for the bond market. It's not a\nproblem for the treasury market. It's a\nproblem for the real economy because\nthat government spending distorts the\nmarket. It distort excuse me, it\ndistorts the economy. It makes it less\nefficient, which means the standard of\nliving for everyone goes\ndown. But you're not going to have a\nproblem. you know, you're not going to\nhave interest rates blow out if the\neconomy is slowing down like\nuh a lot of the market commentators\nassume will happen. But let's get to my\npoint here right\nhere. This is just before, let's see, is\nthis Eastern time? I'm assuming this is\nEastern time. I don't know if it adjusts\nto your time locally because I know I'm\nan hour behind, but right about when\nthe initial claims came out, you saw the\nyields really go down. I think it was\nright in here. You see it go down on the\n10-year Treasury, which would make sense\nbecause growth inflation expectations\nare declining. We got the big news\nyesterday with ADP. This is kind of\nbacking it up. So, in advance of the\nnon-farm payrolls tomorrow, they're kind\nof leaning on the side of expectations\ndeclining. Therefore, you see the price\naction in the bond market. Then, just a\nfew minutes or an hour later, it\nskyrockets up. You're like, what on\nearth is going on here? It's like this\nbipolar Treasury market. And what\nhappened here is Trump came out and\nannounced that he had just talked to Xi\nJinping for like 90 minutes and they had\na very productive phone call. So what\nthe market takes that to mean is that\nthere's a good chance that they'll come\nto some sort of negotiation. And what\ndoes that mean? Well, that means growth\nit that means growth expectations\nincrease. So boom, you see the 10-year\nTreasury yield really spike. I mean,\nit's still below 4.4, before. But just\nthe inday action, you can see how the\nvolatility is created in this bipolar\nmarket is created by one minute\ninflation and growth expectations\ndecline, the next minute it's up. It's\njust all headline driven. But none of it\nis driven by headlines regarding the\ndeficits or the debt. It's almost always\nregarding what's happening with the or\nwhat could be happening with the\nunderlying economy.\nAgain, rates don't control the economy.\nThey just simply uh are a\nreflection of what is happening in the\noverall\neconomy. So, this is something we're\ngoing to have to watch closely. Um we\ncould see some Twitter fireworks tonight\nas well. And if you're watching these\nTwitter\nfireworks, I would, you know, after you\nget done just laughing or crying,\nwhichever one you\nchoose, it's so pathetic. Uh, you've got\nto sit back and ask\nyourself, how does this impact the\nconsumer? How does this\nimpact spending? How does this\nimpact the willingness to take\nrisk in not just the domestic economy\nbut the global economy? And then what\ndoes this do for the leverage Trump has\nfor negotiating with other countries\nwhen, pardon my French, but all these\nother countries are just watching this\n show and saying, you know, we're\njust dealing with infants here. We're\nnot even dealing with adults. Uh, does\nthat give him less ability to negotiate?\nI all questions I think we should be\nasking right now. All right, guys. On\nthat bombshell, enjoy the rest of your\nafternoon. It could be a very spicy\nweekend to say the\nleast. And definitely stay tuned for\ntomorrow because we've got the the\nnon-farm payrolls come out and that\ncould have huge huge economic\nimplications along with everything else\nthat's going on. So guys, make sure\nyou're standing up for freedom, liberty,\nfree market, capitalism and I will see\nyou on the next video."

      "content": "Hello fellow Robo Capitals. Hope you're\nwell. We had a huge move in interest\nrates today all along the curve,\nespecially the 2-year, the 10 year.\nThat's what I was most focused on. We're\ngoing to dive into it, but first and\nforemost, I want to figure out what on\nearth happened to trigger this huge\nmove. I will keep saying that throughout\nthe rest of the video, the huge move.\nThere we go. All right, so let's go\nright over to the BLS because this is I\nthink in part what triggered it. So\nright here we had the nonfarm\npayrolls. You guys know how important\nthis is at least for the market. I don't\nknow if it tells us precisely what's\nhappening with the labor market, but the\nstock market, the bond market for sure\nobviously is paying a lot of attention\nto this non-farm payroll. Now the\nexpectations were in fact let's go over\nto market watch where is the\ntrusted calendar\nand where did it\ngo? I just had it. Oh well I can pull it\nup again. I just had it\nhere. So going down to Oh that's right\nbecause I clicked on the BLS. That's\nThat's what happened. All right. So,\nbottom line, expectations were for 125\nand we got 139. So, the market and well,\nCNBC, the commentators, the financial\nanalysts were all talking about how this\nis a great number. This is fantastic.\nAnd in fact, I heard some of the people\nin the Trump administration really spin\nthis and say, 'Well, this just proves\nhow great of a job Donald Trump is doing\nbecause unemployment or the uh\nemployment the payroll numbers exceeded\nexpectations. They don't tell you that\nthe expectations were incredibly\nlow. It's like, yeah, if you put the\nexpectations at negative\n500,000 and we come in at\n-400,000, yeah, that beat expectations,\nbut it doesn't necessarily mean that\nit's a good number. And when we have an\neconomy of 350 million people, you have\nto have a certain amount of job growth\njust to maintain the number of jobs and\ntherefore the aggregate demand. And I\ncan assure you 139 that ain't cutting\nthe mustard. So, anything really below\n200,000, you're in you're in the red\nzone right there. And of course, we have\nto pay attention to the trend and the\ntrend is down. But today, it wasn't\nabout the trend. It was simply about the\nfact that this exceeded expectations.\nSo, let's go back here and look at the\nmove in the 10-year Treasury. Now, we'll\ngo over to CNBC. That's probably\neasiest.\nSo up 11 basis points and check out this\nchart any day\nnow.\nSo we're just humming right along here\nabout 3.8 and then the non-farm payrolls\ncome out and boom an explosion higher\nand then it just trends higher\nthroughout the entire day till you\nfinish above 4.5%.\nNow, I don't think this tells the whole\nstory. We got to go back fiveday chart.\nSo, you see right here, we get ADP, the\npayroll numbers, and that really was\nbelow expectations to say the least. I\nmean, we're at 110 and we got 37,000.\nSo, it just plummets as you would expect\nwhen it's all about growth and inflation\nexpectations. Another thing that I've\njust been harping on, so I'm not going\nto beat a dead horse here, but what's\nreally driving this? It's it's\ninflation. It's growth. It's inflation.\nIt's growth. Nothing happened here with\nthe deficits or the debt. Like nothing.\nThis is not deficits or debt. This is\nstrict strictly growth in inflation\nexpectations. So anyway, um we have this\nbig move down here because of the ADP\npayrolls. And it might have that been\nright here as\nwell. And then we had news right about\nhere where Trump came out and said that\nhe had a call with Xi Jinping and it\nwent very well. So what happened?\nInterest rates go straight up. Why?\nBecause it's all about growth. Because\nwe've got this narrative that the only\nproblem with our our economy is just\nready to rock and\nroll. But the only thing holding it back\nis just these, you know, these tariffs.\nIf we could somehow just get rid of\nthese tariffs, the economy would just\nrocket higher. This is kind of the\nnarrative right here, at least with a\nlot of the participants. So that's why\nyou get this big bump right here,\nbecause now all of a sudden we've got\ngrowth in inflation declining. Now we've\ngot growth expectations increasing\nslightly. But then you combine that with\nthe the the turbocharged numbers today\nthat the only thing we care about, we\ndidn't care about how low the\nexpectations were to begin with. The\nonly thing that was concerning was it\nwas higher than expected. Higher than\nexpected. Oh my gosh, it's higher than\nexpected. Plus, Trump, we got the taco\ntrade. You know, Trump always changes\nhis mind. I forgot what it was. Always\nchickens out. There you go. Always\nchickens out. So, we've got this taco\nthing going on. So, most likely Trump is\ngoing to get rid of the tariffs or\nthey're going to come down even further.\nWe're going to have some sort of\nsettlement, if you will, with China, the\nbiggest player. And on top of that,\npayrolls are exceeding expectations. Oh\nmy gosh. What are you going to do?\nYou're going to it's it's risk on. It's\nrisk on. And then you see the 10-year\nTreasury being sold off. So, I would\nimagine that this is a knee-jerk\nreaction. I think you're likely I'm not\nsaying that yields go down below 4% over\nthe next uh couple weeks, but I would\nnot be surprised if they kind of trend\ndown back to maybe where they started.\nLet's just say 4.4 4.35 or the next week\nor so. But this is a regardless, this is\na big move. And another thing that\nyou'll see is it's not like we had this\nbig move up and then we start kind of\ncrashing back back down. It kept going\nhigher and higher and higher and higher\npretty much throughout the\nday. So the 10-year moved 50 basis\npoints. Let's go over to the\n2-year here. Another huge move. Same up\n11 basis points up to 4.45%.\nSo just a couple days ago, let's look at\na five day chart. We were down I'm at\nthe lows here. We're down 4 point or\nexcuse me\n3.84. So this is the marketplace telling\nyou that oh my gosh again the Trump\ntariffs are decreasing and we got great\nhigher thanex expected payroll numbers.\nTherefore there's no way the Fed is\ngoing to cut. And I think that's what\nyou're seeing here with the the two-year\nTreasury. Now, we'll have to see how\nthis plays out. I think that this is\ngoing to trend down slowly over the next\nweek, but we'll have to see. Now, one of\nthe reasons I think it will trend down\nbecause I think that once people digest\nthe actual numbers over the weekend,\nthey'll be like, \"Wait a minute here.\nmaybe those the non-farm payroll wasn't\nas good as we thought it was. If you\nlook at the household survey, it started\nto drop again. So, you guys know from\nwatching my videos that we've had this\nhuge discrepancy between the non-farm\npayroll or the establishment survey and\nthe household survey. And the household\nis what really goes into uh or was used\nto calculate the unemployment rate if\nI'm not mistaken. and we had this huge\ndelta, but then it started to to to get\nto the point where the household survey\nwas getting back or at least trending\ncloser to the establishment survey,\ngiving us the impression that that was\nthe one that was off, if you will. But\nnow, Zero Hedge, we're going to go over\nto this in a moment, points out that it\nstarts to plummet again and you're\nseeing that gap get more extreme.\nSo, let's shoot over to that article.\nAnd right here, the unemployment rate\nwas the result of the modest increase in\nthe number of employed people from\n7.166 million to\n7.237 million. While the labor force\ndeclined by 600,000 from 171 million\nroughly to 170. More importantly, the\ndisconnect between the household survey\nand the establishment survey is\nback as the number of employed workers\nplunged tumbled. I think that's a typo\nthere. Uh plunged by six almost\n700,000 even as payrolls reportedly\nrose. So this is the real headscratcher.\nYou look at the household survey and\nit's saying the number of employed\nworkers fell by almost\n700,000. But yet the establishment\nsurvey is telling us that we had overall\nincrease of\n139,000. Like how do you square that\ncircle? Like like I don't I don't get\nit. So, a lot and I think this is very\num this very insightful on Zero Hedges\npart and I know a lot of the the\nquoteunquote experts are kind of asking\nthis question. It's great. Okay,\nawesome. It exceeded expectations, but\nthen when you look beneath the hood,\nyou're kind of scratching your head and\nyou're like, \"Wait a minute. This this\njust does doesn't make sense.\" Let's go\nover some of their data points here.\nnumber of\njobless uh less than five weeks\nincreased by\n264,000 doesn't seem that bullish in May\nthe un the employment population ratio\ndeclined\nby.3 okay the number of people employed\npart-time for economic reasons at 4.6\nsix changed little. Okay, not too much\nthere. Labor force, we talked about\nthat. Yeah. So, the hourly earnings\nticked up slightly. So, that was\ngood. It's all about healthcare. You\nsee, healthcare added 62,000\njobs. Employment in the leisure and\nhospitality looks like\nplus 48,000.\nI listened to an interesting thesis\ntoday where the guy's point was it's\ngoing to be very hard for the United\nStates to go into a recession because\nyou have so many baby boomers getting to\nthe age where they need a lot of medical\nattention and that's expensive. That's\nreally expensive. So this creates a lot\nof\nspending that uh you otherwise wouldn't\nhave. And you see this with the\nhealthcare. I mean every single time I\nlook at one of these reports like the\nleading job creator is almost always\nhealthare. Almost always\nhealthare. And that would make sense.\nNow I don't know that this prevents the\nUnited States from going into a\nrecession. that I would be a little\nsuspicious, but it was an interesting\ntheory, an interesting\nhypothesis. Last but not least, there\nwas acute softness in both the breakdown\nbetween full and part-time where the\nformer tumbled by\n623,000. Wait a minute here. Did I read\nthat right?\nwas an acute softness in both the\nbreakdown between full and part-time\nworkers where the former as in full-time\nworkers tumbled by\n623,000 and the latter increased by\n33,000. Yeah.\nSee, finally the number I know Zero\nHedge likes to harp on this quite a bit\nand I I guess the the MAGA people like\nto pay a lot of attention to this. I'm\nnot saying that's right or wrong. It\njust kind of is what it is. So for them\nuh finally the number of native native\nborn workers tumbled by\n444,000 while foreignb born workers also\ndropped by\n224 and easing back from the record set\ntwo months ago. Yeah. So, I mean, every\nsingle thing that I'm reading when\nyou kind of look beneath the hood is\ntumbled,\nplummeted, crashed, except for the\nestablishment survey, which is up\n139. It's just bizarre, isn't it? Except\nfor wages. I guess wages were up\nslightly. I think the jury's out is the\nbottom line. When you look at the ADP\nnumbers from the other day that were\nhorrific, you look at the initial\nclaims, which wasn't terrible, but I\nmean, it's going in the wrong direction,\nthat's for sure. Up at\n247,000, and we have this number today,\nwhich again, it's not terrible, but it's\ndefinitely not good even the headline\nnumber and because expectations were so\nlow. But then when you actually look at\nthe details, you could see how yeah, I\ndon't know, this could be perceived as a\nlittle more bearish than than bullish.\nAnd I think that's just being completely\nobjective. So, this is why I think over\nif I had to just give you a quick\nprediction for what it's worth here, I\nthink next week I wouldn't be surprised\nto see rates kind of trickle back down\nto where they were to start, you know,\nmaybe the 10-year uh going back beneath\n4.4, something like that, and probably\nthe 2-year going back beneath uh 3.95.\nWe'll have to see how it plays out.\nMaybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right. Now,\nthere's another thing that I wanted to\ndiscuss and and this is what's happening\nwith other central banks around the\nworld because I know a lot of Americans\nobviously for for obvious reasons get\nhyperfocused on the United States and\nthe Federal Reserve, but but I think\nthat is um too myopic. And I think if\nyou just look at the Federal Reserve,\nyou're like, \"Oh, well, what's the\nproblem? The economy is doing okay. It's\nnot great. stuck in the mud is what I've\nbeen calling it lately. But the Fed at\n4.33, it's not like those rates are\nhistorically high. So, seems like maybe\nthey're in the sweet spot right now.\nIt's kind of like a Goldilocks economy,\nbut you completely ignore what's\nhappening in the rest of the world where\nit's literally just falling apart. And\nwhen I mean falling apart, I'm talking\nabout inflation expectations are\ncrashing. I we just saw the\nECB yesterday when they came out and\ndropped rates. Why? Because or one of\nthe main reasons was because their\ninflation metric, the main one they\nfocus on dropped below 2%. Of course,\nthat's their target because they're just\nlike the Fed. And another thing that I'd\nlike to point out is if you go back like\n6 months, 9 months, every single other\ncentral bank for the most part in the\ndeveloped world was very similar to the\nFed and they were higher for longer,\nhigher for longer, higher for longer.\nYou know, they're all saying this higher\nfor longer, higher for longer. Maybe it\nwas about a year ago, maybe not uh as\nrecent as six months, but about a year\nago, they're all saying, \"Oh no,\ninflation is sticky.\" You know, and then\neven when the ECB started cutting rates,\nyou remember that? They said, \"Oh, well,\nhere's what we're going to do. We're\njust every other meeting we're going to\ndrop by 25 basis points.\" And then you\nfast\nforward 8 months, nine months, a year,\nand they're cutting it every single\nmeeting, not every other meeting. So,\nwhat changed? Well, what changed is the\ndeterioration of the economy. And so,\nit's forcing them to drop rates. and\ntheir inflation rate is just uh kind of\na proxy for what's happening where\naggregate demand is decreasing and\neconomic output is getting that right\nhook from Tyson. So, but it's not just\nthe ECB, it's almost every single\ncentral\nbank. And so, you you just have to\nwonder, is the Fed going to continue to\nbe this outlier forever? Maybe, maybe.\nBut what's the probability of that?\nThere are no certainties. are only\nprobabilities and I don't know maybe you\nwould come to the conclusion that\nprobability is\nhigh but for for me I've got a bit of a\ndifferent view so what I wanted to point\nout is just something I I just saw\nbefore we went live here and this is the\ncentral bank of\nIndia let's see if we can pull up a\nstory it should be right in the\nnews here we\ngo So we'll just go to CNBC. Keep it\nconsistent. India's central bank beats\nmarket expectations to deliver outsized\nrate cut of 50 basis points. India's\ncentral bank delivered an outsized rate\ncut to its benchmark policy beginning\nbringing excuse me it to\n5.5%. This is the third straight cut\nsince February and below the median\nestimates of 5.75. The RBI also changed\nits monetary policy stance to neutral\nfrom\naccommodative and it's it's because I\nbelieve the inflation rates coming down\nthere. They're probably worried about\nthe unemployment rate going up. I mean,\nvery similar to what we're seeing in\nSouth Korea, what we're seeing in\nAustralia, in New Zealand, in Canada, uh\nobviously in China, that goes without\nsaying, and then of course in the uh\nEuro zone.\nSo, I wanted to bring that up just so\nyou guys are aware of what's happening\nwith global central banks because I\nthink that has to go into your analysis\nif you're trying to predict the\nprobabilities of the Fed dropping more\nthan let's just say twice or once or\nwhatever the market is pricing in right\nnow. You you can't just look at the\ndomestic economy. I think you've got to\nlook outside because usually they're\ntied at the hip. It's it's a it's\nglobally synchronized as Snyder always\nsays and if you look at past economic if\nyou look at past cycles where of\ninterest rate hikes of interest rate\ncuts you see that especially with these\ndeveloped economies they're usually kind\nof tied at the hip and it's very rare\nthat you have one of these outliers with\nthe United States. So, I\nguess what you have to decide is at some\npoint we're likely going to revert to\nthe mean, so to speak. So, that's going\nto happen one of two ways. Either all\nthese other central banks are going to\nraise their rates. They're going to stop\ncutting and they're going to just\nmagically start raising their rates\nbecause their economy just starts\nbooming out of nowhere. and then they\ntake rates back to up to meet the Fed or\nthe Fed is going to start cutting\ndramatically to get more in line with\nthe ECB and these other central banks.\nWe'll have to see how this plays\nout. All right, guys. Now, for I know a\nlot of you own gold, so this brings me\nto the sponsor that we've had for the\nlast couple months, which I'm very proud\nto say is Monetary Metals. I really like\nthese guys. I'm good buddies with Keith,\nthe owner over there, and they've been\ndoing these lease programs for about the\nlast eight years or so. And I I thought,\nyou know, I haven't taken a sponsor\nbefore, but when they presented this\nopportunity to me, I'm like, \"Yeah, I\nthink this probably makes a lot of sense\nbecause a lot of the people that watch\nmy videos, they own gold, but a lot of\nthem own physical.\" And maybe not I'm\nnot saying 100%, you know, I don't or\nI'm not saying anyone would want to put\n100% with a leasing program, but maybe a\nportion of it where instead of having to\npay someone a storage fee, they can\nactually pay you and you get paid in\ngold. So, I've got an account with them\nand I put about uh\n$40,000. So, I got about $40,000 of gold\nin there and I've had it for two or\nthree months now and it's working great.\nI've made some interest paid in gold. Uh\nthe user interface is pretty\nstraightforward. Uh but they've got\ngreat customer service. So if you're\nlooking for an alternative for gold\nstorage, one that actually pays you in\ngold, check it out. It's\nmonetary-metals.comgamin. And if you\nguys are kind of scratching your head\nsaying, \"Well, I don't get it, George.\nHow on earth can someone pay me uh to\nstore my gold? it it seems like there's\njust way too much risk and I totally get\nit. The model is uh a little complex and\nyou have to understand why jewelers, as\nan example, would want to hedge their\ngold inventory because that's really\nkind of what it's all about. So, what I\ndid is an explainer video and Josh, go\nahead and put that in the chat and then\nput that in the description if you\nwould. And so, if you watch that\nexplainer video, I think it'll make a\nlot more sense. And if you have any\nfurther questions, just give them a\ncall, tell them George sent you, and I'm\nsure they'll be happy to sit down and\npatiently answer all your questions to\nsee if it's a good fit. All right, guys,\non that bombshell, enjoy the rest of\nyour afternoon. Enjoy the weekend. As\nalways, make sure you're standing up for\nfreedom, liberty, free market,\ncapitalism. We'll see you on the next\nvideo."

      "title": "WARNING_ ADP Job Numbers Revised MASSIVELY Down",
      "date": "2025-06-10T18:01:14.245Z",
      "type": "TXT",
      "content": "With the US payroll report looming on\nFriday, the American jobs market is\ntaking center stage. And it did not\nstart out well. ADP missed twice with a\ndownward revision to prior months, plus\nthe lowest private payroll gain in two\nyears for the month of May. It was so\nbad that President Trump lashed out at\nFed Chair Jay Powell on social media.\nAnd that wasn't all. The closely watched\nISM services sector index fell into\ncontraction compounding all of these\nnegatives in the growing negative\npicture with the economy now appearing\nto stumble badly and in these key areas\nespecially jobs. Of course, treasury\nyields are moving lower with new recent\nlows registering in the middle and long\nend of the yield curve. And as I pointed\nout yesterday, while there's near\neuphoric re-risking in stocks, the\nfundamental measures like swap spreads\nnever really budged from their April\ndeflation lows. The big one though, as I\nsaid, jobs and especially services.\nADP's data show exactly what we've been\nexpecting after the artificial high to\nlast year. So, here comes the payback,\nwhich has its measure of employment\nright on the cusp of a negative number\nin May. In fact, the last time ADP was\nthis low, it had been the same month of\nthe banking crisis back in 2023. So,\nwith the bad jobs number plus ISM\nservices flashing a rare recession\nsignal, especially with a huge hit to\norders, this is the critical moment for\nthe economy. That's why President Trump\nwas lashing out angrily at Fed Chair\nPowell, actually saying on Truth Social\nthat it's too late, meaning the Fed\nwaited too long to cut rates again. So\nhere we have an example of a\npresidential reaction to weakness by\nreacting to the lack of reaction from\nthe Federal Reserve. Anyway you slice\nit, it ends up with an economy that's\nincreasingly in trouble and more and\nmore people can see it up to including\npoliticians. And even Jay Powell can see\nit too. he's just more fixated on\nexpectations theory of inflation when in\nreality any any increase in consumer\nprices as we've seen all around the\nglobal economy leads to exactly what the\ndata has been showing remember this is\nfor the month of May both the ISM and\nADP the stock market has already\nrebounded and soared ahead at the same\ntime you have tariff delays and possible\ntrade deals and it didn't matter the\neconomic data has gotten worse because\nthis isn't really about tariffs and\ntrade wars. So what ADP reported was an\nincrease in private payrolls according\nto their measures of just\n37,000. That was way below expectations\nwhich were an accelerating to an\nincrease of 110,000. And that was down\nfrom a downward revise just 60,000 in\nApril. So here you have April and May\nwith barely a 100,000 increase in\nprivate perils between the two of them.\nAgain, I'll point this out again. This\nis for May after the stock market\nrebound, after the tariff delays, all\nthe positive news, at least that's\nthat's incorporated in the stock prices.\nThis is not really about trade wars.\nIt's about a weak economy that barely\nskirted having worse last year, last\nsummer, ironically, because of tariffs\nand the artificial highs and distortions\nthat were produced at the end of last\nyear. And so what ADP showed is that\nthere were job losses on net in every\nsingle size category except for what\nthey define as midsize. those firms with\nemployees between 50 and\n249. What that indicates is that these\njob losses and the the difficulties in\nthe labor market were indeed widespread.\nAt the very least, there's not a whole\nlot of hiring going on, which of course\nwe know, and maybe even some uptick in\nlayoff activity. As far as individual\nindustries, ADP shows net losses of\n17,000 in professional business\nservices, which is a key important\ncyclical signal that we've talked about\nmany times before. Plus also job losses\non net in education and health care\nservices which are traditionally sort of\ncyclical recessionp proof which means\nthat the economy really might be\nstumbling badly if we see more job\nlosses accumulate in especially\neducation and health services. There\nwere also small losses in the goods\neconomy in both manufacturing and mining\nthat were balanced out by continued\nconstruction activity. A lot of that\nhaving to do with government projects.\nBut either way, you you add it all\ntogether and you've got an economy\naccording to ADP with a labor market\nthat's running barely above positive in\na way that we haven't seen since 2020.\nBecause this is not just about May or\nApril and May, it's been coming this\nentire time, really since the middle of\nlast year. That's what we're going to\nsee in the ISM2. The economy weakened\nwith the global inflection that I\npointed out last March and April. It\ncame close to the traditional recession\nlast summer and then a whole bunch of\nartificial distortions to end last year.\nWe see that in private payrolls like\nADP's data where it increased to the end\nof 2024. But then contrary to\nexpectations contrary to Jay Powell's\nassertion of strong and resilient,\neverything began to roll over up to and\nincluding the job market and payroll\nestimates. Now before we get back to the\nrest of today's video, I want to tell\nyou about today's video sponsor. We talk\nall the time on this channel about the\ndangers the world is facing. Trying to\ncome to grips with the aftermath of the\npandemic and the lockdowns, the\ndifficulties associated with the supply\nshock and price illusion. Not to mention\nstill living in the shadow of the 2008\ncrisis. To put it mildly, there's a lot\nof systemic uncertainty. Now, I've\nrecommended gold as a store value hedge\nfor years. In fact, it's the ultimate\nerror hedge. While gold prices are at an\nall-time high, price appreciation isn't\nthe only way to profit. You can earn a\nyield on gold paid in gold without\nselling your metal. When the price of\ngold increases, so does the cost to\nstore it and ensure it. Don't lose money\nowning gold. Earn a yield on it instead.\nAnd Monetary Metals allows you to earn\nup to 4% on your metal in their gold\nleasing program. And you start earning\nthat 4% yield immediately upon funding\nyour account. The yield you earn is paid\nin ounces of physical gold or silver,\nwhich you get in addition to any price\nappreciation from gold and silver during\nthe year. So, join the thousands of\ninvestors earning interest in physical\ngold and silver every month with\nMonetary Metals. There's a link in the\ndescription of this video that has all\nthe information that you need. We thank\nMonetary Metals for their sponsorship.\nAnd now, back to the rest of this video.\nThe weakness in ADP is of course\nconfounded mainstream economists. As was\nreported, hiring decelerated to the\nslowest pace in two years as sectors\nincluding business services, education,\nand health shed jobs, pointing to a\nweakened demand for workers. Private\nsector payrolls increased by 37,000 last\nmonth, according to ADP research, which\nwas lower than all the estimates in a\nBloomberg survey of economists, and it\nmarked the second month in a row when\nfigures were well below expectations.\nThis is not a one-month random\nfluctuation. And of course, as I\nmentioned on social media, Trump\nreiterated that Federal Reserve Chair\nJay Powell should lower interest rates\nfollowing the ADP report. Last week, the\npresident had called Powell to the White\nHouse and pressed him to cut rates\nbecause rate cuts are a reaction to the\nweakness that we're seeing in all this\neconomic data. And the president\npressing the Fed chair to to lower rates\nis also a reaction because he's not\ngetting the reaction that he would like.\nWe'll talk a little bit more about what\nTrump is really trying to do here, but\neither way, all of it adds up to from\nthe labor market perspective, this this\ncritical week where we're getting lots\nof updates on jobs and employment. It\ndid not start out well at all. And then\nADP was in many ways overshadowed by the\nISM services index, which fell below 50.\nBefore we get to services though, we\nalready saw weakness in the ISM\nmanufacturing and even before that with\nthe ISM Chicago business barometer. But\nwith the ISM manufacturing that was\nsupposed to increase from 48.7 in April,\nexpectations were for it to rise to 49\na.5, but instead it dropped 2/10 more\nand further indicated the payback after\nthe artificial high last year. That's\nreally what's that's the dominant trend\nin the economy right now is the payback\nafter the artificial distortions. That's\nwhat's weakening uh especially the labor\nmarket but also the services sector\nindustries as we'll see here but also\nmanufacturing which was supposed to be\nexperiencing a renaissance and a\nturnaround as it is turning out as the\nevidence is showing it wasn't a\nrenaissance it wasn't a recovery it was\njust the artificial high and that means\nwe're getting into the thick of payback\nwhich is why we see all of these\nnegative negative uh indications showing\nup all over the\neconomy ISM Chicago business barometer\nwhich was often taken as a proxy for\nespecially the automobiles automobile\nindustries because of the location in\nthe Midwest Chicago. That one was also\nsupposed to rise to 45 from 44.6 in\nApril. Instead, it fell more than four\npoints back to 40.5, which is again\nconsistent with all the artificiality\nsurrounding the car business. Americans\nbought a ton of cars, especially in\nMarch and April before before they\nthought prices were going to go up.\nMeaning that there was a lot of\nproduction and imports and shipping and\ntransportation and inventories leading\nup to those months as businesses\nprepared for the entire tariff shock and\ndistortion. But now we've got the\nweakness showing up in services. And\nsince services make up the majority of\nthe US economy, this is a pretty\nsubstantial stumble, especially when you\nput it together with ADP showed net job\nlosses in these key services industries.\nIt's not a good start to a week where\nwe're focusing on labor market. What ISM\nreported was their services PMI at\n49.9. Now, anything below 53, as I've\nbeen pointing out the last couple years,\nanything below 53, you're already in\ntrouble. You're into downturn territory.\nBelow 50 puts you in rare companies I'll\nget to in just a second. The ISM had\npicked up to 51.6 in April, but that was\na shortrun fluctuation. As you can see,\nthe trend was down from the artificial\nhigh last year to begin with. And it had\nbeen sinking toward traditional\nrecession or what everybody recognizes a\nrecession. Last year after the global\ninflection around April, the ISM\nservices PMI fell below 50 twice last\nyear in April and again in June. Before\nthen, it shot up to a high of 55.8 by\nOctober. There was some positive\nsentiment around the Fed's rate cuts,\nespecially the 50 50 basis point cut in\nSeptember. the incoming administration\nwhich promised to be businessfriendly\nplus the tariff distortions and a whole\nbunch of others. The ISM services sector\nwas looking pretty good in last fall.\nBut even starting in November, it was\nalready beginning to roll over and it's\nbeen downhill ever since then, finally\ndropping below 50 here in May. Again,\nI'll point this out. That's after the\ntariff delays. That's during the stock\nmarket rebound. But yet here the ISM is\nin rare recession territory below\n50. How rare is it? Well, between\nJanuary 2010 and the end of 2019, so the\ndecades of the 2010s, the entire silent\ndepression, the ISM services PMI was\nunder 50 zero times, not a single once.\nAnd in between March of 2003 and January\n2008 during the middle 2000's expansion,\nthe ISM services PMI was less than 50\nexactly zero times. So when the economy\nis expanding, this goes before the\n2001.com recession too. When the economy\nis expanding, you don't see the ISM\nservices below 50. You rarely see it\nbelow 53, but you do not see it below\n50. And here we have over the last 13\nmonths three indications below 50\nindicating just how serious the economic\nweakness has gotten to be not just in\nthe good sector which is experiencing an\ninventory-led recession since 2022 but\nhere more recently over the last 13\nmonths in US\nservices. In fact, you look at the look\nat the history. The ISM services PMI\ndidn't go below 50 until January 2008,\nwhich was the second month of the\nofficial declared NBER recession. It\ndidn't go below 50 in the cycle before\nthe.com recession until April 2001, also\nthe second month of the recession. So,\nlike I said, ISM below 50 is a rare\nrecession consistent signal that tells\nyou that there is serious weakness in\nthe services economy. Therefore, the\noverall situation, which is one reason\nwhy we get all these negative\nindications in things like\nADP, these are the same 13 months, by\nthe way, when central banks started\ncutting rates. They went from higher for\nlonger, we're never going to get we're\nnever going to have low rates again to\noh crap, we better start cutting faster.\nAnd while everybody thought that was\njust weakness outside the US, as I've\nmentioned here, the ISM services PMI\nthree times below 50 during those same\n15 months, the US economy is not immune.\nPeople's perception of the economy has\nbeen shaped by Jay Powell on the one\nhand, which is one reason why President\nTrump is doing what he's doing, but also\nthe stock market. As long as the stock\nmarket is moving higher, everybody\nthinks everything must be fine. when the\ndata shows that the US economy globally\nsynchronized headed into trouble last\nyear with every place everywhere else\nonly to only to then turn around at the\nlast possible minute not because of a\nrecovery or because it was strong and\nresilient but because of a bunch of\nartificial factors that are now wearing\noff. We've got the payback. We got the\nother side of the artificiality. We got\nthe fragile economy that was in trouble\nin 2024. the same one that convinced the\nFed it better get with the rest of the\nglobal central bank in Cabal and start\nlowering interest rates. As bad as the\nheadline was for ISM services, the new\norders index was even worse. Now,\nanything less than 55 for ISM services\nis that's the that's the danger zone uh\nfor new orders. It had been as high as\n59.4 last September after last year's\nfall off into the global inflection. The\n59.4 4 representing the high from the\nartificial trend last year. But then it\nbegan to fall off again late into the\nyear, early 2025. By April, it was back\ndown to 52.3. But then from 52.3 in\nApril, it crashed to\n46.4 in May. Again, despite the stock\nmarket rebound and the tariff delays.\nHow bad is\n46.4? That's the worst since December\n2022 and the second lowest since the\nmiddle of 2020. So the service sector by\nall these accounts growing trouble\nthere. Even the business activity index\nit dropped 3.7 points here in May to\njust 50. Well 50 doesn't sound bad.\nAgain this is the services PMI but\nbusiness activity at 50 within the\nservices PMI is the weakest level in\nfive years. Couple reasons why this is\nhappening to the services part of the\neconomy. Well, the first part is price\nsqueezes on consumers. Prices that are\ngoing to go up for non-discretionary\nitems. Consumers have said they're\ncutting back. We've seen that in the\nrising personal savings rate. Where are\nthey going to be cutting back? Well, if\nyou can't cut back on necessities\nbecause the prices are rising there, you\nhave to cut your discretionary spending,\nwhich tends to be services. So, services\nis the other side of that. And then\nservice sector businesses, they're\ngetting squeezed in their own margins\nbecause input costs are going up too. So\nthe input costs are going up that they\ncan't pass along to their customers\nwithout provoking a volume backlash,\nwhich means that service sector economic\nparticipants, service sector firms and\ncompanies are really taking the brunt of\nthis fragile economy and the tariff\nshock. But as we've seen in Europe,\nservice providers in Europe tried to\nraise prices because of the rising input\ncosts. And what happened? Volumes fell\noff. That's what we're getting here in\nthe US services sector industries as\nwell. They're trying to raise prices as\nmuch as they can, but finding it very\ndifficult to do so. And when they do,\nbusiness falls off. Orders just\ndisappear. So, with that economic\nbackdrop, not surprising, then Treasury\nyields are leaking lower. The 2-year\nTreasury as of this morning before I\nstarted recording was at 386, 387. And\nif that holds, that will be the lowest\nfor the important two-year spot on the\ncurve since May 7th. And it's been\nrolling back lower ever since the middle\nof last month, along with a whole lot of\nindications, including what I talked\nabout yesterday with the Swiss Frank\ngetting stronger. All of these risk\naversion, flight to safety numbers that\nbegan to flash more and more warnings in\nthe second half of May. And now we're\nseeing why that's the case. As I said in\nthe video not long ago, watch the twos.\nAnd what did the twos do? While the long\nend of the yield curve was selling off\nat least, you know, the fluctuation over\nthe short run, the 2-year hung in there\nright around 4% all month, that's where\nthe fundamentals were. The 10-year as of\nthis morning was at 4.36% and maybe\nmoving lower. And that's its lowest\nsince May 7th as well. As Treasury\nyields at the long end are going lower,\nthe curve flattening out a little bit,\nthe long end starting to to reflect some\nof the same fundamentals as the short\nend, we're not going to hear any more\ntalk of bad auctions and treasuries not\nhaving enough buyers and all the crap\nthat flows out whenever treasuries have\na short-term fluctuation like they did\nin May or back in December. As I said in\nthat prior video, it's the 2year where\nthe fundamentals get priced because this\nis the bull steepening case.\nHistorically, that's where the money is.\nIf fundamentals do become as bad as they\nseem to be in all of these economic\ndata, then the two-year is going to go\ndown a lot more than the long end, which\nmeans any uncertainty that happens in\nthese shortrun periods, you sell the\nlong end and hold the twos. So, watch\nthe twos, not necessarily ignore the\nlong end, but realize what the long end\nis actually signaling, which is almost\nnever what the mainstream says about. It\nwasn't about bad debts or bad auctions\nor too many treasuries. It was simply\nthe steepening case, bull steepening and\na higher degree of uncertainty until we\nsee the fundamentals that are priced in\nthe twos start to become more and more\nconfirmed, which is what we got in\neconomic data today. And because of\nthat, the president lashed out once\nagain at Jay Powell, who who he thinks\nand who he believes is behind the curve.\nAnd the reason he believes that is\nbecause he sees the economy weakening a\nfar more than is appreciated in most\nplaces around certainly the financial\nmedia but also the New York Stock\nExchange. As CNBC reported today,\nPresident Trump on Wednesday angrily\nurged Federal Reserve Chairman Jay\nPowell to cut interest rates minutes\nafter the payroll firm ADP reported its\nlowest private sector jobs number in\nyears. Quote, \"ADP number out. Too late.\nPowell must now lower the rate, Trump\nwrote on so truth social. He is\nunbelievable, the president said of the\ncentral bank chairman whom he has\nfrequently pressure to shave borrowing\nrates in hopes of spurring economic\ngrowth. Europe has lowered nine times,\nTrump added again because he knows the\neconomy is in rough shape. So what he's\ndoing is getting ahead of that weakness\nby putting the noose around Jay Powell's\nneck. If the economy does worsen along\nthe lines of what the recent economic\ndata suggests and in the way that the\nswap market and the Swiss Frank and the\nyield curve are all projecting, then\nwhat he's doing is saying Jay Powell is\nto blame for all of this. He is\ndefinitely setting Jay Powell up for the\nfall should the economic weakness get a\nlot worse by the time we get to fall\nthis year. So even the president knows\nthe economy is in danger. Otherwise,\nthere's no reason to lash out like this.\nBut when you have confirmation from all\nthe macroeconomic data that continues to\ncome in weaker and weaker and weaker, it\nmakes perfect sense, especially since\nthat's what the Federal Reserve's job\nreally is, to be a lightning rod for\ncriticism, not a central bank. It's not\nan economic management tool. It's a\nplace to manage criticism for times like\nthese. So, we have ADP in the month of\nMay that dropped to near zero. should\nhave been a surprise, but it is because\neverybody keeps following Jay Powell,\nwho is talking about a solid economy and\nlabor market, which is already a\ndowngrade from the strong and resilient\nlabor market he talked about for years.\nAnd then ADP today was followed up by\nISM services, which may be the bigger\nwarning because 53 and below is trouble\nfor the economy given the importance of\nservices. And less than 50 for ISM\nservices is rare. It's almost always\nrecession rare and we should seriously\nconsider the last year as such since\nwe've seen forget how to grow all around\nthe world suddenly remember how to do\nworse ever since last March and April\nwhen these below 50 numbers started to\nshow up in ISM services now being\nmatched here in May despite the rebound\nin stocks as well as tariff\ndelays. Rates are edging lower again\nsecond half of last month and the start\nof this month. Risk aversion rising.\nspreads are deeply negative and the\nmacroeconomic data continues to align\nwith all of it. It's not about trade\nwars. Tariffs didn't break the economy.\nTherefore, tariff delays aren't going to\nfix it. We had forgot how to grow, which\nproduced a lot of consternation and a\nlot of deeply troubling economic signals\nlast year. Now, we're just picking up\nwhere we left off.\nAnd all of today's data also aligns with\nconsumer spending figures which have\nsuggested consumers in the United States\nare already pulling back. I went over\nthose details in the video link below.\nAs always, thank you very much for\njoining me. Huge thank you University\nmembers and subscribers. And until next\ntime, take care."

      "content": "Everybody is talking about the dire\nwarning signals we are getting from the\nTreasury market right now. I think the\nbond market is the key. This Treasury\nSecretary understands and I think the\npresident understands you lose the bond\nmarket, your whole agenda goes in the\nwaste basket. I'm going to explain\nexactly what is going on and if it's\nsomething you should be concerned about\nin three simple fast steps. Step number\none, let's go over WTF just happened.\nWe're going to start by looking at a\nchart of the CPI. This report for April\nwas just released. So over here we've\ngot today's date. We go all the way back\n2018 on the left. We go from 0% up to\n8%. And you guys know what was\nhappening. Ironically, if we chart went\nback here, the Fed was actually trying\nto get inflation up. They thought it was\ntoo low. And then we had the surveis\nsickness. inflation goes down to almost\nzero at least a CPI we're using as a\nproxy and then it skyrockets because of\nstemmies supply shock etc goes all the\nway up to 9.1% in the summer of 2022 but\nthen it comes down now this doesn't mean\nthat prices came down this just means\nthat prices are going up at a slower\npace we call this disinflation so it's\nnot deflation it's\ndisinflation a lot Lot of people get\nconfused by that and that just means\nthat prices are still going up but\nthey're going up at a slower pace. So\nthen we fast forward to today. Now\neverybody thought we were going to see a\nsubstantial increase in the CPI. It was\naround\n2.4%. And the mainstream media, the\nfinancial experts were talking about how\nTrump's tariffs would play into this\nmost recent number. The economic effects\nwill include higher inflation and slower\ngrowth. So although the average\nexpectation was for the CPI to stay\nright around the same, it was all over\nthe place and some experts were\npredicting that it could go as high as\n2.8, maybe even 3% from 2.4 just last\nmonth. So then we had the actual CPI\nprint come\nout and it wasn't greater than 2.4. or\nit wasn't even 2.4, it was less than\n2.3%. Now, I know that this understates\ninflation, but we are just using this as\na proxy for the trend. And whether we\nlike it or not, the Fed is going to make\ntheir decisions based on the official\ninflation numbers, whether that's PCE,\ncore CPI, CPI, etc. So, you would expect\nif we had a soft CPI print that yields\nwould actually go down in the Treasury\nmarket, but we saw the exact opposite.\nWe were seeing yields go up to the point\nwhere today the 10-year Treasury yield\nis trading over\n4.5%. So, this is why the majority of\nthe talking heads in the mainstream\nmedia are saying how this is a big\nwarning sign from the Treasury market.\nThe bond vigilantes are back and the\nbond market is fighting Trump and it's\nfreezing up. We've got all these\nproblems. The Fed has lost control of\ninterest rates at the long end of the\ncurve. And the rationale for why\ninterest rates are going up instead of\ndown is because of things. I'm sure you\nguys have heard this. The deficits are\nblowing out. The debt is at what 37\ntrillion now. And like my good friend\nLynn Alden says, nothing stops this\ntrain. And what she's talking about is\ngovernment deficit spending and the\noverall debt. So what does this mean?\nThe supply of treasuries are going up\nand they'll most likely continue to go\nhigher and higher and higher into the\nfuture. And keep in mind this is\nhappening at the same time when\nsupposedly demand for treasuries is\nplummeting. I mean think about it. All\nthe bond vigilantes are calling the\ngovernment's bluff. They're seeing these\ndeficits. They're seeing the supply\nexplode and they know that this isn't\ngoing to come to an end. In fact, it's\ngoing to get worse. So why on earth\nwould they hold those treasuries? On top\nof that, you have countries like China\nand Japan that are dumping their\ntreasuries for whatever reason. Maybe\nthey're pissed off at Trump. Maybe they\nneed the dollars. Who knows? But you see\nwhy the demand side of the equation\nwould be plummeting while the supply\nside of the equation could be\nskyrocketing which would explain why the\nFed is losing control along into the\ncurve. And this is this huge warning\nthat we're getting. Oh, but wait there\nis more. We also have to realize that\nthe government has to roll over a large\namount of debt every single year. 10\ntrillion, 11 trillion, 12 trillion and\nthe number just grows and grows and\ngrows with the amount of overall debt we\nhave. So if interest rates are going up\nsay to 4.5% and it's just a proxy for\nthe entire curve, but we'll assume that\ninterest rates are all going up. This\nmeans that when the government has to\nroll over that debt, they're going to\nhave to pay higher interest rates. That\nmeans the overall interest burden on the\ndebt goes up as well. So you have this\ndoom loop right where because the supply\nis increasing demand is decreasing which\nmakes interest rates go up. So when you\nhave to roll over the debt the supply\ngoes even higher than it otherwise would\nhave been which makes demand drop even\nmore which makes interest rates go even\nhigher. But before we move on I want to\nhighlight the fact this theory and I'm\nnot saying this is my opinion. I'm just\nexplaining what the rationale is for\nthose people who are arguing that the\nTreasury market is giving this huge\nwarning by the fact that yields are\ngoing up higher and higher and higher.\nBut if this theory is true, it's\npredicated upon one\nthing and that one thing is that\nsupply of treasuries actually impacts\nyields. But what if that's not true?\nStep number two. So, we need to\ndetermine what exactly drives interest\nrates or the 10-year Treasury yield\nalong into the curve. So, we know if the\nTreasury market is giving us a warning,\nand if so, what the warning actually is.\nSo, let's go over to a chart of the\n10-year Treasury yield. We can go all\nthe way back to the early 1960s and we\nsee that 62 or so, right around 3.8, and\nit just goes higher and higher and\nhigher and higher over a long period of\ntime. And as we know, it peaked out in\nthe late 1970s, early 1980s, right\naround\n15%. But since that time, what has the\n10-year Treasury done as far as the\nyield? It has gone straight down.\nNow more recently it's gone up. So we\nsee right here 2020 the survea sickness\nit was\nat.76. Well we just talked about in step\nnumber one how now it's up at\n4.5% and this is why all the people are\nsaying that the deficits are out of\ncontrol. The debt is exploding which is\nabsolutely true. But they're saying this\nis the reason that interest rates are\nincreasing because we have this deluge\nof supply that's only going to get\nworse. Let's go ahead and put that\ntheory to the test because again it\nrevolves around supply actually\nimpacting yields that being the major\ndriver of what's happening with\ntreasuries. So if you have a lot of\nsupply that comes online, well there's\nnot enough demand, yields go up. And\nintuitively that makes a lot of\nsense. So if this theory is\ntrue, what you would expect to see as\nfar as the supply of treasuries would be\na dramatic\ndecrease because why? Well, interest\nrates went down substantially. Let's\njust call it from\n1981 all the way to the beginning of\n2020. So we go from let's say 15% down\nto 71%\nroughly. So if supply really matter well\nif interest rates are going down well\nthat means then the supply of treasuries\nis\ndecreasing. So now let's go ahead and\nlook at the federal debt because this is\nbasically a record of how many\ntreasuries exist. The supply of\ntreasuries. So back in\n198081 we the debt in other words the\nsupply of treasuries was 877 billion\nroughly. Okay fantastic. Where are we\ntoday? Lower than\nthat. Uh no we would actually be not\njust higher we would be 36 times higher.\nAnd I'm actually understating it. Today\nit's over $36\ntrillion. So let me restate that. We\nhave gone from let's call it 900 billion\nin the supply of\ntreasuries to 36 trillion in supply of\ntreasuries. And during that time the\ninterest rate on the 10-year Treasury\nyield went\ndown, not up. And it went down by a big\namount. It's not like it just went from\n15% down to 10. I mean, it went from 15%\nto where it is today,\n4.5. But then at one point when the debt\nwas, let's just say, 30\ntrillion, it was down at.71.\nNow I know a lot of you right about now\nare probably saying okay George well it\nis about supply but you got to look at\nthe debt to GDP ratio because if the\nsupply of treasuries is increasing but\nthe GDP in other words the size of the\nUS economy is growing even faster then\nthere's going to be plenty of demand to\nabsorb the deluge of supply. So what we\nreally have to look at is to see if the\ndebt to GDP goes up and that's when we\nwould expect to see interest rates\nskyrocket. Okay. Well, let's go over and\nlook at a chart of debt to GDP. And here\nit is. In 1980, it was right around 30\n31%. Okay, fantastic. What is it today?\nOh, wow. That would be 121%.\nSo, let me just state that again to make\nsure we're all on the same page. As\ninterest rates went down, I call it 15\n14% from 1980 to\n2020, the debt to GDP ratio went from\n31% up to over 100% just before the\nsurveys sickness. Now, I know a lot of\nyou right about now are saying, \"Aha,\nokay, George. Okay, okay, okay.\" Well,\nwhat has happened since the surveys of\nsickness? Look, we've had the debt to\nGDP go from, let's just call it 105 up\nto 121.\nAnd hello, interest rates have gone up,\nand they absolutely have. If we look at\nthat chart of the 10-year Treasury\nyield, we see that it was very, very low\n2020, and now, like we said in step\nnumber one, right around\n4.5%. But is this due to the increase in\nthe debt? Or maybe it's due to the\ndeficit? I we haven't even talked about\nthat yet. So let's go over to a chart\nbefore we move\nfurther and look at the deficit as a\npercentage of\nGDP. And obviously the more negative\nthis is, the bigger the deficit, right?\nbecause if it's a positive number, then\nwe actually have a surplus like we had\nin 2000. So going back to 1980, we're\nright around\n2.5%. So the deficit was 2.5% of GDP. We\nlook at where we are today, and that's\nat\n6.2%. So again, there's no correlation\nwhatsoever. In fact, there's almost an\ninverse correlation between the debt to\nGDP, the overall debt, and the deficits\nin terms of the 10-year Treasury yield.\nSo, this begs the question, what does\ndrive interest rates at the long end of\nthe curve or what historically has done\nthat? Again, looking out into the\nfuture, there are no certainties. There\nare only probabilities. But we can\ndetermine those probabilities based on\nwhat we have seen happen over and over\nand over and over again in the past and\nthen understand why it happened that\nway. So let's look at a chart of nominal\nGDP in the United States. So this by\ndefinition is growth and inflation.\nOkay? Because the growth would be real\nGDP plus inflation equals nominal GDP.\nWe'll go back to the early 1960s because\nthat's when it matches up reasonably\nwith our chart of the 10-year Treasury\nyield. And we see it's right around I\nmean barely above zero here. We'll call\nit uh n call it 2%. And then from 1960\nor the early 1960s to call it\n1978, what happens? Nominal GDP goes\nstraight up. Well, not straight up.\nDidn't go up in a straight line, that's\nfor sure. But as you can see, it went\nfrom, let's just say, 1% all the way up\nto\n15%. So, nominal GDP increased\ndramatically,\ndramatically. Okay. Well, what happened\nto the 10-year Treasury yield? Let's\npull up that chart. And we go back to\nthe early 1960s when it was right around\neh call up 4% or so. And then it goes\nstraight up to like we said earlier\n15%. So, and by the way, it peaks out\nright around 15%. And where did nominal\nGDP peak out? Call it in the late\n1970s. That would be right at\n15%. So now let's look at what happened\nto nominal GDP since 1980. Okay. Well,\nwe start right around, call it 15, 13,\n14% or so, and it goes all the way down\nto the point prior to the survea\nsickness when it was right around\n5%. And during that time, the interest\nrate on the 10-year Treasury yield went\nfrom, call it 15% straight down to\nroughly 3%. So, when you look at these\nlong-term trends, it becomes very\nobvious the 10-year Treasury yield or\nthe long end of the curve, interest\nrates really are dictated by growth and\ninflation expectations. If you want to\nlook at it like nominal GDP, that's\nfine. That's where the strong\ncorrelation is. If you look at the\ndeficits, the debt, the debt to GDP,\nthere's almost an inverse relationship\nbetween those and the 10-year Treasury\nyield. So, when we're trying to\ninterpret what the 10-year Treasury\nyield is telling us about today, about\nthe market, about the economy, we have\nto start by looking at it through the\nlens of growth and inflation\nexpectations. And I also want to point\nout that since we hit that low in the\n10-year Treasury yield during the\nsurveys sickness, that yields have gone\nup. And what would you expect to happen\nto nominal GDP during that time? It went\nup as well.\nStep number three. So, is there a\nproblem? Should you be concerned? And\nthe answer is yes. The Treasury market\nis giving us a warning signal. But it's\nthe exact opposite warning that you're\nhearing in the mainstream media. Let me\ngo ahead and explain. We'll start by\nBanker Bob right in the middle. Banker\nBob has his top hat. Very greedy. Loves\nmoney. You can tell by the dollar signs\nin his eyes. and he has a balance sheet.\nAssets on the left, liabilities on the\nright. But he wants to expand his\nbalance sheet because, as you guys know,\nhe simply makes money by pocketing a\nspread between what he's receiving on\nhis assets and what he's paying on his\nliabilities. Basically, it's kind of an\narbitrage play. Well, banker Bob has a\ncouple different options right now to go\nahead and expand his balance sheet. Now,\nkeep in mind before we go any further,\nthe money that Bob is using, he is\nborrowing from someone else. He's not\nusing his own money. So, that's why I've\ngot a B right here. So, whether he's\nborrowing that from a depositor or he's\nborrowing it from, let's just say, one\nof his banker buddies, he's borrowing\nthe money at 2%. And we'll assume these\nare dollars. So, banker Bob has a couple\ndifferent options. Number one, he can\nbuy a treasury at 4%. Or he can take\nthis balance sheet capacity and use it\nto create a loan and lend money out into\nthe real economy, whether it's to a\ncorporation, small, midsize business,\netc. And here he could get\n6%. Well, obviously he's going to take\nthe 6%, right? Wrong. But you guys know\nthat it's not just about the reward.\nIt's\nalso about the amount of risk. So Bob is\ngoing to look out into the economic\nfuture and if he sees storm clouds, he's\ngoing to peg the risk\nhigh. Okay. Well, if there's a lot of\nrisk out there, I definitely don't want\nto lend into the real economy because I\nmight not get paid back. So, I'm going\nto go ahead and opt for the Treasury and\npocket that 2% spread. But let's assume\nfor a moment that Bob looks out into the\neconomy and he's like, \"Wow, it's\nrunning on all eight cylinders, strong,\nresilient, the future is looking bright.\nSo, the risk is extremely low.\" Well, in\nthat case, he's going to opt for the\n6%. Anyone would. It's just simple\ncommon sense. But what's another word\nfor high or low risk? It's simply growth\nin inflation\nexpectations. Because if the risk is\nlow, well then growth in inflation\nexpectations probably going to be pretty\nhigh as far as nominal GDP. But if risk\nis very high, well, this is predicting\nthat nominal GDP probably goes down or\nat the very best flatlines. And this is\nwhy in a nutshell, the 10-year Treasury\nyield simply follows nominal GDP or\ngrowth and inflation expectations. And\nI'm not saying the 10-year Treasury\nyield is going to be pegged at so if\nnominal GDP growth is 5% then the\n10-year Treasury yield is going to be\n5%. No, it's just the trend is going to\nbe the same. And we saw that going all\nthe way back to 1960s in step number\ntwo. So now I know a lot of you right\nabout now are saying, \"Okay, George.\nWell, the joke is on Bob because he went\nout and bought all these treasuries at\n4%. But if inflation goes up to 5%, now\nhe's screwed because he's losing\npurchasing power.\" No. What you're\nforgetting is Bob isn't using his own\nmoney. He's borrowing at\n2%. So it's an arbitrage play. Let me\nput it to you in another way. Let's say\nby doing this deal, he's going to pocket\n$100 million. Or let's say that if you\nwere Bob, you would pocket $100 million\non this deal. So if I gave you $100\nmillion right now, would you take it? I\nthink most of you would say yes. But\nwhat if I said, whoa, whoa, whoa, time\nout. Before you take that $und00 million\nfor free, forewarned, inflation next\nyear in the United States might be 5%.\nYou're still going to take the $100\nmillion, aren't you? Why? Because it's\nsimply an arbitrage. You're pocketing a\nspread. Now, what happens if Bent comes\nout and dumps another 23 trillion dollar\nof 10-year treasuries on the market? So,\nthe interest rate goes from 4% up to 5%.\nWell, if the risk stays the same, in\nother words, growth in inflation\nexpectations, then what's Bob gonna do?\nOr let me ask a question a different\nway. What would you\ndo? You would buy as many of those\ntreasuries as you possibly could because\nnow instead of pocketing a hundred\nmillion spread, now you're pocketing,\nlet's just say $150 million spread. And\nyou and all your other banker buddies\nare going to buy those treasuries until\nthe interest rate goes back down to 4%.\nSo, I like to explain this so you\nunderstand the why behind this\ncorrelation between what we've seen in\nthe 10-year Treasury yield and let's\njust say nominal GDP going all the way\nback to the 1960s. And you could take it\nback further than that if you wanted to.\nSo, now that we understand the why,\nwell, let's go ahead and think through\nsome of the other options Bob has right\nnow as we speak. So editor, go ahead and\nthrow up a chart of the Fed funds rate\nversus the 10-year Treasury yield. And\nwe can see that it's almost flat. So\nwhat this means is there's a lot of\nbanker bobs out there that are choosing\nto buy 10-year treasuries at, let's just\nsay,\n4.5%. As opposed to a one-mon treasury\nat, let's say, 4.3 or 4.4. Well, why\nwould they do that? They're taking\nanother 10 years of risk and they're\nreally not being compensated at all for\nit. It all goes back to risk because if\nBob sees this as very high, he's going\nto choose to buy the 10-year Treasury\nyield as opposed to the threemonth or\nthe one-mon T bill, which is going to\nflatten the curve. So when the curve is\nflat like it is right now or inverted,\nthis tells you that there is massive\ndemand for the long end of the curve,\nnot no demand like you're hearing in the\nmainstream media. So you say, \"Well,\nthat's great news. There's massive\ndemand. We don't really have to worry\nabout the supply stuff because of\neverything you talked about in step\nnumber two, George.\" No, no, no, no, no.\nThe fact that there's massive demand at\nthe long end of the curve is a bad sign.\nIt's not a good sign. And why is it a\nbad sign? Because it tells us that\nbanker Bob looks out another three,\nfour, however many years, and he sees\nthat the risk is very, very high. As we\nwould want to see the curve steep. So,\nwe would want to see the 10-year\nTreasury yield, let's say, 150 basis\npoints above Fed funds. And this would\ntell us that banker Bob sees very low\nrisk and therefore he's taking his\nbalance sheet and using it to lend out\ninto the real economy, which is what we\nwant instead of buying those treasuries.\nSo again, the market warning isn't that\nthere's no demand at the long end of the\ncurve. The market warning is that there\nis too much demand at the long end of\nthe curve. Hey guys, I'd like to\npersonally invite each and every one of\nyou to attend this year's Rebel\nCapitalist Live.

      "type": "TXT",
      "content": "The Federal Reserve and Jerome Pal are\nnow predicting the dreaded stagflation\nfor the United States economy where\nprices continue to go higher and higher\nand higher along with the unemployment\nrate. On Wednesday, Powell said, quote,\n\"Unemployment is likely to go up as the\neconomy slows in all likelihood and\ninflation is likely to go up as tariffs\nfind their way and some part of those\ntariffs come to be paid by the public.\"\nEnd quote. He didn't use the exact word,\nbut what he was describing is\nstagflation. I'm going to explain why\nthey're making this dire prediction and\nwhether or not I agree in three simple\nfast steps. Step number one, let's go\nover this insider intel from the\nCleveland Fed. They have this algorithm\nor this realtime inflation tool they\ncall now casting. So we look at this\nchart to kind of the beginning of May\nback to April 1st. So what we're trying\nto do here is we're trying to predict\nwhat the next CPI print will be and\ntherefore how the Fed is going to use\nthat to determine whether or not they're\ngoing to cut interest rates at their\nnext meeting. On the left we go from 0%\nup to 5%. So at the beginning of April\nwas right around 2.3 which was last\nmonth's reading I believe. And so then\nthey go down here. Why? Because energy\nprices have really collapsed. Just last\nweek oil got down to\n$55 a barrel. So again this red line\nwhich represents the headline CPI and\nthat's the inflation rate you usually\nsee expressed in the mainstream media.\nIt goes down below 2%. in fact almost\ndown to 1% here and then it kind of goes\nback up right around 1.5 or so and then\ngoing into May it goes up slightly. But\nI want you to pay very close attention\nto this blue line because according to\nthe Fed, this is what they use to\ndetermine whether or not they're going\nto cut interest rates, hike interest\nrates, or pause. Now, this is the core\nCPE. You can see it's very similar to\nthe Fed's favorite metric, which is the\ncore PCE editor. You can go ahead and\ndisplay this on the chart we've got. But\nwhat the now casting tool is predicting\nfor the month of April is that we\nstarted right around at 3%, we dipped\ndown to call it\n2.6 and then it's pretty much flat. Now,\nthis is key because the Fed wants this\nto be at 2%. So from the Fed's\nstandpoint, they're looking at this and\nsaying, \"Okay, inflation is quote\nunquote sticky.\" You hear that in the\nmainstream media all the time, and this\nis the reason why. So they're looking\nout in the economic horizon and seeing\ntariffs come in. They're expecting that\nto increase prices. So it looks like\nwith the CPI, they're expecting energy\nprices to kind of rebound and food\nprices to go back up. So they're\nconcerned that this blue line as well as\nthis red line is going to continue to go\nhigher and higher and higher because of\ntariffs uncertainty because of supply\nshortages very similar to what we saw\nduring 2021 and\n2022. But at the same time they're\nlooking at the labor market and they're\nseeing the data starting to get soft. As\nan example, last non-farm payroll was\n177,000, which exceeded expectations,\nbut it was a lot lower than the month\nprior. So, the trend is definitely down.\nNow, I also want to point out that when\nyou look at these consumer surveys, they\ncall this the soft data. You see that\ninflation\nexpectations are really, really high for\n2025. And I know this skews Democrat,\nthe Republicans are expecting prices to\ngo up as well. So, the Fed believes that\nif there are inflation expectations,\nthen the consumer will go out and start\nstockpiling stuff because they're going\nto go out and frontrun the higher\nprices. Now, I don't buy into this for a\nvariety of reasons, but what I'm doing\nis I'm just showing you how the Fed\nviews the economy. So when you combine\nthe tariffs with the higher inflation\nexpectations that we see in the soft\ndata and then you get the softening in\nthe labor market, this is why Jerome\nPowell and the Federal Reserve are\npredicting that the United States is\ngoing to go into\nstagflation. Now the key here is asking\nourselves what tools does the Fed have\nto not just prevent stagflation but to\nprevent unemployment going higher or to\nprevent prices from going higher or\nlower for that matter. Can they actually\ndo anything even if this is their\nconcern?\nStep number two. Now, we're going to\nreveal the truth about the Federal\nReserve that they don't want you to\nknow. Let's start by looking at a chart\nof the current yield curve. So, at the\nfront of the curve, we have the\novernight rate. This is the federal\nfunds rate, and this is the rate that\nthey control. So when Jerome Powell\ncomes out on CNBC and says we paused or\nwe cut rates by 25 basis points or we\nincrease rates, they're talking about\nthe overnight rate the Fed\nfunds. But then there's several other\npoints on this curve. We've got the one\nmonth, two month, three month, the\n2-year, the 10-year, the 30-year, and\nyou guys hear about the 10-year all the\ntime because this is most correlated to\nmortgages, which impacts obviously a lot\nof Americans. But look at the shape of\nthe curve right now. So, what I want you\nto focus on initially is the sixmonth to\nlet's just call it the 10year. So pretty\nmuch the entire portion of this curve is\nbelow below the overnight rate where the\nFed has their interest rates or where\nthey paused and kept them at let's just\nsay\n4.25%. So let's just do a quick thought\nexperiment and ask ourselves what would\nhave happened to these interest rates if\nthe Fed would have dropped by 25 basis\npoints. Would that have impacted the\n2-year, the three-year, the 10-year, the\n30-year? Maybe a little, but probably\nnot that much. Where you would have seen\nthe impact is just pretty much on the\none month T bill to the six-month T\nbill. So now I want you to ask yourself\nthe question, do you really think that a\nplus or minus 25 basis points on the one\nmonth to six month T bill will\ndramatically impact inflation, higher or\nlower? Or do you think the plus or minus\n25 basis points from the one-mon T bill\nto the six-month T bill will\ndramatically impact the unemployment\nrate? Of course not. This is nonsense.\nAnd let's go through another quick\nthought experiment. Let's just assume\nthat Trump has a across the board 10%\ntariff just to keep the math easy. So\nwhat would happen to the prices of those\nimports? Well, they would go up and\nlet's just say they go up by 5%. Just to\nkeep the example simple again. So now\nyou've got that basket of goods,\nconsumer prices, and some of the items\ngo up by\n5%. Great. Let's just assume that the\nFed had interest rates 25 basis points\nhigher. again between the one month and\nthe six-month T bill. Is that going to\nimpact what the prices of those imports\nare? Of course not. That holds no\nbearing whatsoever on the Chinese widget\nmaker charging X as opposed to Y.\nThey're going to charge whatever it is\nthey're going to charge based on their\nbottom line and the amount of Trump's\ntariffs. What Jerome Pal does with the\novernight rate holds no bearing on that\nwhatsoever. So then you have to ask the\nquestion, okay, well, why is he even\nworried about inflation? Well, he's\nworried about it because prices of those\nthings might go up, but this doesn't\nmean that they're going to continue to\ngo up. Pretty much what happens when you\nhave this, let's say, 5% price\nadjustment is prices go up by 5% and\nthen that's it. It's not like they go up\nby 5% then 10% then 20 then 30 then 40\njust because you have a 5% tariff. So\nthe whole point here is really the Fed\njust controls the front end of the curve\nand it's just out to a six-month T bill.\nAnd I don't think that anyone in their\nright mind would argue that has a\ndramatic impact on prices, unemployment,\nor what the Chinese charge for their\nwidgets that they're importing to the\nUnited States based on the tariffs. And\nthe reason for this again is because\nmost of the curve is under the Fed funds\nrate right now. So if they were to lower\nit, they're just coming down to where\nthe rest of the curve is. And at the\nlong end, let's say the 10-year and the\n30-year, they really don't respond too\nmuch to the Fed funds rate, they more so\nrespond to growth and inflation\nexpectations. So, the bottom line is\nwhatever is going to happen in the\neconomy is going to happen regardless of\nthe Fed. The only thing they can do is\njust react to it. It's like someone\ndriving a car. Most people think and the\nmainstream media would like you to\nbelieve that the Fed is actually at the\nwheel when in reality they're in the\nback\nseat. Step number three. So what is my\nprediction for the US economy? Do I\nagree or disagree with the Fed? Well,\nmost of you know from watching my videos\nthere's a very high probability I'm\ngoing to\ndisagree with the Federal Reserve. But\nlet's get into it by looking at a chart\nof the CPI. Now, this chart\n1983 all the way back to\n1970. This is the infamous decade of the\n1970s. Why was it infamous? Because of\nstagflation. On the left, we go from 0%\nup to 15%. Now, this red line\nrepresents, of course, the rate of\ninflation. By the way, back then I think\nthey measured it a lot more accurately\nthan they do today. So, we start 1970\nright around five or 6%. We go down to\nwe get to about 1973. We're hovering\naround, let's just call it 3 4% and then\nit goes straight up to a point where\nwe're right around 10 12%. Then it comes\nall the way down to say five or six\npercent before it rebounds,\nreacelerates, and then goes straight up\nto 14% before Vulkar put the brakes on\nit. And that's a controversial issue as\nwell. But that's when Vulkar came in and\ngot the credit for putting the brakes on\nit that took inflation all the way back\ndown to a lower level that we saw\nthroughout the 1980s.\nSo, a couple things I think you'll find\nextremely interesting. From\n1970 to\n1974, M2 money supply went up\nby\n50%. Now, I know a lot of you right\nabout now are saying to yourself, \"Oh,\nGeorge, 50%. That's absolutely nothing\ncompared to what we've seen recently.\nLet's just say from 2020 to 2024. We\nknow that just in about a 12-month time,\nthe Fed increased M2 money supply by\n25% alone. And therefore, any analogy or\nany comparison that you have to the\n1970s is a complete moot\nissue. But you got to look at the data.\nSo, editor, go ahead and throw up a\nchart. And we can see that from 2020 to\n2024, M2 money supply grew by\n35%. In other words, 15% less than it\ngrew from 1970 to\n1974. More on that in just a moment.\nNow, a lot of you are probably also\nsaying, \"Well, you can't use this as a\ngood example because we have all these\ntariffs.\" Yeah, but think about what we\nhad in 1974. Right at the beginning, we\nhad oil skyrocket. Editor, go ahead and\nthrow up a chart of this as well. So,\nthis is very similar to what we might\nexperience with the tariffs. Why?\nBecause oil's an input to almost every\nsingle good you buy. whether it was made\nfrom oil or oil was used to transport it\nfrom A to B. So my point here is the\nnumber of currency units or M2 money\nsupply, however you want to say it, was\na lot higher in the 1970s than it is\ntoday or it has been since the survea\nsickness. And we do have a very\ndisruptive component for the economy.\nNow it might be tariffs, but back then\nit was oil. So now let's kind of focus\non where the recessions were during the\n1970s and into the early 1980s. So the\nfirst recession starts right around\nYeah, editor, you can help me out with\nthis one, but let's just say right about\nhere.\nOkay, so you'll notice that this point\nwhere we started the\nrecession is a lot higher than it is\nwhen we exited the recession. and\nbottomed out. Let's just say we exited\nthe recession around right here and the\nCPI continued to go down. But you see\nthe exact same thing happened in the\nnext recession that started let's say at\naround here and then we come out around\nwell there's a couple recessions back to\nback. We come out right around here.\nSo the main takeaway is even in the\n1970s, the decade that is known for\nstagflation, the CPI or the rate of\ninflation was lower when you came out of\nthe recession than it was at the\nbeginning of a recession. So what I'm\nhighlighting is recessions in the United\nStates are always\ndisinflationary. Meaning you don't see a\nrecession where prices or the rate of\ninflation prices will go up but the rate\nof inflation goes higher and higher and\nhigher and higher along with the\nunemployment rate going higher and\nhigher and higher. It's always you see\nthis big spike in the unemployment rate\nat the beginning or the middle of the\nrecession and then you get that\ndisinflation that we were talking about\nand the exact same thing here.\nUnemployment rate spikes then you get\nthe\ndisinflation. So my prediction is when\nwe have a recession, whether that's 2025\nor 2026, and we see the unemployment\nrate spike, it'll play out the exact\nsame way it's played out every single\ntime throughout modern US history. And\nthat is the rate of inflation going\ndown, not going up. Hey guys, I'd like\nto personally invite each and every one\nof you to attend this year's Rebel\nCapitalist Live.

      "title": "US Debt Downgrade Is A Much Bigger Deal Than You Think (Here's Why)",
      "date": "2025-06-10T18:01:14.246Z",
      "type": "TXT",
      "content": "Everybody is talking about how the\nUnited States debt was just downgraded\nand how this could lead to a crisis. It\nis a warning sign quite frankly that the\nUnited States does not have its\nfinancial house in order and hasn't for\na really long time and there will be a\nprice to pay for that. When we see\ndowngrades like this, it typically makes\nthe cost of borrowing more expensive for\nthe consumer. So the question becomes,\nis it time to panic? The answer is yes,\nbut not for the reasons you're hearing\nin the mainstream financial media. I'm\ngoing to explain this to you in three\nsimple fast steps. Step number one,\nlet's go over why this downgrade\nhappened. Well, it's pretty obvious. We\nstart with a chart of the United States\ndebt itself. Today's date go all the way\nback to 2000. On the left, we go from 4\ntrillion, almost a cute number, up to 40\ntrillion. And you can see back in 2000\nwe were right around oh I don't know\nlet's just say six or so and then in\n2005 we get up to about eight and then\nto GFC it really ramps up. Now what I\nwant you to notice is really the\ntrend how it's really increased in three\ndifferent stages based on a recession.\nSo, what I'm referring to is if you just\ntake this trend line that we were on\nprior to the GFC and extrapolate that\nforward, I'm doing the best to draw a\nstraight line there. You can see that\njust eyeballing it, we'd maybe have,\nlet's just say, $12 trillion in debt.\nBut then if we fast forward to the GFC,\nyou can see we had this bump up and then\nthe trend becomes a lot steeper. So if\nwe take this line straight out into\nwhere we are today, we could say the\ndebt might be around 28 trillion. But\nyou guys know the debt right now is not\nat 28\ntrillion. It's all the way at about 36\n37 trillion. So then we have the surveis\nsickness and very similar to the GFC it\ngoes straight up but then once it starts\nleveling out slightly it still goes up\nat a faster rate than it was going up\nduring this time frame or post\nGFC. So this trend line once again\nbecomes steeper. So, if we take this\nout, let's just say, I don't know, five\nyears into the future, I don't see why\nthe United States debt wouldn't be $50\ntrillion, if not higher. And this is\nreally the key. So when a ratings agency\nlooks at this, they see the spending and\nhow the uncontrolled spending even in\nthe big beautiful bill. It might be big\nand beautiful, but I can assure you it's\ngoing to be expensive. So they look at\nthe government spending like a drunken\nsailor, your drunk, insolvent Uncle\nSam, and then they say, \"My gosh, this\nis going to lead to these huge deficits,\nespecially if we have an economic\nslowdown.\" Because most of you know that\nregardless of what the debt to GDP is\nright now, say five or six, if we go\ninto a recession, what the United States\nand the government has proven over and\nover and over again, is they're going to\nspend even more money and that deficit\nto GDP is going to increase. Editor, I'm\nsure you've been throwing up a chart to\nillustrate exactly what I'm referring\nto. So then these deficits blow out. The\ndebt to GDP goes higher and higher and\nhigher. And why is this a problem?\nBecause the GDP is, let's just say, a\nproxy for tax receipts. So if the debt\nor the payments on the debt are growing\na lot faster than the revenue coming in,\nobviously this is a problem. And if you\nlook at the United States like a\ncorporation, this leads to additional\ncredit risk. And that's the main reason\nyou saw a downgrade from Moody's. Now,\nthe timing of the downgrade is\ninteresting. I don't know why they\ndidn't do this during the Biden\nadministration, but I'll let you draw\nyour own conclusions on that. So, then\nwe have to continue to think this\nthrough. You know, what does it mean if\nthe United States is a bigger credit\nrisk? Well, the argument is that\ninterest rates are going to go a lot\nhigher, especially at the long end of\nthe curve. let's say the 10-year 30-year\nthat increases rates in the real\neconomy. Rates such as mortgages. But it\ndoesn't end there because this would be\na drag on the economy. So the Fed would\nhave to come in and do yield curve\ncontrol. They'd have to buy the long end\nof the curve. Therefore, they would have\nto quote unquote print money. And this\nputs downward pressure on the United\nStates dollar, increasing inflation and\nmaking rates go even higher, which would\nmake the Fed print even more. Now, I\nwant to be very clear. This isn't\nnecessarily my view. I'm just explaining\nthe mainstream narrative and what you're\ngoing to hear if you turn on CNBC or go\nto financial Twitter. But before we move\non, I want to point out something very\nimportant down here. When we get to this\nthought experiment, it assumes that all\nthis equals interest rates going up and\nthat would prompt the Fed to come in and\ndo yield curve control. But what if\ninterest rates don't go up? What if they\nactually go\ndown? Step number two. Now, to know if\ninterest rates are actually going to go\nup or the probability of them going up\nas a result of this debt downgrade, the\ngood news is we actually have prior debt\ndowngrade. You see, there's three\nratings agencies and two of the three\nhave already downgraded the United\nStates debt. Moody was just the outlier.\nThey were the third one that has now\njoined the debt downgrade party, if you\nwill. But the first downgrade of the\nUnited States was back in August of\n2011. So, we can just go ahead and look\nat a chart of the 10-year Treasury yield\nfrom, let's just say, 2010 to today's\ndate. And you can see that interest\nrates did not\nskyrocket. In fact, interest rates went\nstraight down and they continued to stay\ndown for a long time. So, we can safely\nassume the first downgrade didn't lead\nto higher interest rates. In fact, if\nanything, it led to lower interest\nrates. Why? More on that in just a\nmoment. But let's go ahead and fast\nforward to the next downgrade. And this\nwas in August of\n2023. Now, it is true they did increase\nafter this downgrade. They spiked, but\nthen look what happened. They come right\nback down. And did they trend higher and\nhigher and higher? No. We've pretty much\nbeen in a range, this choppy range since\nthat time to the point where now we're\nat, call it 4.4,\n4.5. But what I also want to point out\nabout the second time this happened is\nthe trend was already up. So if we go\nback to let's just say April of 2023,\nthe 10-year Treasury yield started\nrising at this point.\nway before we got to August. And when\nthese ratings agencies come out and\ndowngrade the debt, it's not like anyone\nknows about it in advance. So, the\nmarket wasn't pricing this in is what\nI'm trying to say. So, did the interest\nrates spike after August as a result of\nthis downgrade or was this just part of\nthe overall trend? We'll never know\nbecause you can't prove a\ncounterfactual. But what we do know is\nit definitely didn't lead to an upward\ntrend in interest rates, which is what\nyou're hearing right now in the\nmainstream media. Now, I know a lot of\nyou right about now are saying to\nyourself, \"Whoa, George, time out here.\nYou just got done telling me that now\nit's time to really be concerned about\nthis downgrade.\" But now in this step,\nyou're saying that interest rates\nprobably won't go up. And in fact,\nthey're going to continue to go up or\ndown, not based on a downgrade or\ndeficits or supply of treasuries, but\nlike you say in most of your videos,\nit's going to revert back to growth and\ninflation expectations. And what we've\nseen in past downgrades is interest\nrates have actually gone down. So,\nwouldn't that be a good thing? Wh Why\nare you telling me that now I should\nreally be concerned about this? Well,\nI'm glad you asked and I'm going to\nreveal the answer right\nnow. Step number three. So, here's why\nthe debt downgrade actually matters and\nwhy you should be concerned. So, we\nstart right here with the government,\nyour drunk, insolvent uncle Sam. And we\nhave resources. So, obviously, we're\noversimplifying the economy. So let's\njust assume in this super super super\nsimple economy we only have three\nresources. Now as Thomas Soul teaches us\nthese resources are scarce they have\nalternative uses. So in this super super\nsuper simple economy we have human\nresources people. We have steel. I have\nno idea what steel looks like so you'll\njust have to go with the s. And we have\noil. Okay this makes sense.\nNow in a free market what happens is we\nhave this thing called a price signal\nand this allocates scarce resources with\nalternative uses very very efficiently.\nSo the economy is maximizing on the\nscarce resources it has and therefore\neconomic growth is as high as it\npossibly could be. In other words, the\neconomy is running on all eight\ncylinders. Let me show you how this\nworks. So, we've got the United States\nright here. Obviously, you can tell\nthere's Florida. And up here in the\nPacific Northwest, we have everyone's\nfavorite Moody the Millennial with their\nblue hair. Now, Moody the Millennial\nwants to build some housing, let's say.\nSo, they're in the market for some steel\nor lumber, whatever it is, and they're\nwilling to pay\n$75. But Texas Tim is down here, and he\nis willing to pay\n$100 for the steel or lumber. Okay.\nWell, why is that? Because no one wants\nto live in the Pacific Northwest because\nit's a dump. because everyone there is\nhomeless and a drug addict and working\nat Starbucks. So, they all\ngo down to Texas. Sorry for I grew up in\nPortland, Oregon, so I'm allowed to say\nthat. You guys know I'm\novereneneralizing. It's a joke for\nheaven's sakes. It's a joke. So, all\nthese people want to get the hell out of\nDodge. So, they go down to Texas. So,\nTexas has this flow of population.\nTherefore, they're bidding up the prices\nfor things like residential homes,\nthings where you would probably need\nlumber or steel or probably all three of\nthese resources. So then what's going to\nhappen is because Texas Tim or Tom or\nwhatever I said his name was, he's\nbidding a higher price, then these\nscarce resources with alternative uses\nare going to go to Texas instead of\ngoing to the Pacific Northwest. And at\nthe end of the day, who is the decision\nmaker\nhere? It isn't Texas, Tim. It isn't\nreally the people selling the scarce\nresources. It's the\nconsumer. It's the average Joe and Jane\nbecause they're going from here to here.\nThey're voting with their feet, if you\nwill. And therefore, this at the end of\nthe day is what is allocating scarce\nresources with alternative uses. And\nthat's why the free market and this\nprice mechanism is so important. So if\nprices are going up, the bottom line\nhere, the main takeaway is that's where\nthe resources are going to go because\nthat's where they're best utilized. And\nif prices are going down, then resources\nare going to move away from those areas\nbecause those resources aren't being\nutilized or there's not as much demand\nfor them from the consumer, the average\nJoe and Jane. This is why a bottoms up\napproach is always better than a topdown\napproach. So, let's go back to your\ndrunk insolvent Uncle Sam. So, what does\nhe do? He goes out to the marketplace or\nthe real economy. Uh, sometimes the\nfinancial economy. I don't know if you\ncould include that in there, but he's\neither going to sell bonds or he's going\nto tax the average Joe and James here.\nBut the bottom line is he's going to get\ndollars. So he gets these dollars and he\nlooks around and he's like, \"hm, how can\nI allocate these dollars to buy the most\namount of votes?\" So let's assume in\nthis scenario, he assumes that he's\ngoing to be able to buy the most amount\nof votes from Moody the Millennial.\nObviously, we're not talking about Trump\nhere, although any government, I don't\ncare who's running it, is going to\nmisallocate these resources. So, your\ndrunk, insolvent Uncle Sam takes the\nmoney, buys the scarce resources, and\ntakes those scarce resources and\nallocates them not to where they're\ngoing to be utilized in the best way,\nbut where they're going to be wasted.\nThe Austrians call this a misallocation\nof resources and\nmalinvestment. So, a lot of you watching\nthis video right now are probably\nsaying, \"Okay, so what? So, we've got\nsome resources that go over there.\nWhat's the big deal? Well, the big deal\nis this wildly distorts the economy. And\nwhat this means for each and every one\nof you is that means economic growth is\nlower. Now, it might not drop, but it's\nlower than it otherwise would have been.\nAnd what that means is the standard of\nliving for all of us, especially the\npoor and middle class, deteriorates and\nis much much lower than it would have\nbeen if these resources were allocated\nto where they're going to be utilized in\nthe most efficient manner by the free\nmarket and the price signal price\nmechanism instead of this misallocation\nof resources by your drunk, insolvent\nUncle Sam. So, what I'm trying to\nillustrate in this video is we have a\nhuge problem with the deficits and the\ndebt going higher and higher and higher.\nAnd this Moody's downgrade should be a\nwake-up call to all of us. But that\nproblem isn't necessarily in the\nTreasury market. And it's likely not\ngoing to show up in higher interest\nrates. The problem is in the real\neconomy where unfortunately the price\nwill have to be paid by all Americans\nbut will disproportionately negatively\nimpact the poor and middle\nclass.

      "date": "2025-06-10T18:01:14.246Z",
      "type": "TXT",
      "content": "Did Donald Trump just secretly issue a\ncentral bank digital currency? The\nanswer is he's trying to. I'm going to\nreveal all the details in three simple\nfast steps. Step number one, let's go\nover what on earth or WTF is a CBDC.\nBecause when most people think about\nthis, they envision the Fed and they\nhave this Fedcoin that they come out\nwhich is programmable. And this\ndefinitely impacts or decreases our\nprivacy. It gives them control over\nmoney, how it's spent. It allows them to\ngive you a social score because they're\nmonitoring every single transaction in\nreal time. And therefore, the central\nplanners are going to force the\nindividuals and the businesses in the\nreal economy to start using this\nFedcoin, if you will, instead of US\ndollars. And this view of a central bank\ndigital currency is totally incorrect.\nLet me show you what I'm referring to.\nWe got the Fed right here. Their balance\nsheet assets on the left, liabilities on\nthe right. Currently, they have bank\nreserves denominated in dollars. These\nare liabilities of the Fed.\nNow, let's assume for a moment that\neveryone, all of you watching this video\nright now, had an account at the Fed,\njust like the big banks. Okay? Well,\nwhat the Fed would do is they would\ncreate bank reserves. They would put\nthem into your account. They would be\ndenominated in dollars, of course, just\nlike they're just electronic dollars,\nreally, liability of the Fed. And you\nwould take those dollars and you would\nspend them out into the real economy.\nNow, if your account was at the Fed,\nwould they know every single one of your\ntransactions in real time? Therefore, if\nthey wanted to, could they give you a\nsocial score? The answer is yes. And if\nall the bank accounts were on the Fed's\nbalance sheet, would the money in those\naccounts be programmable, especially now\nwith artificial intelligence? The answer\nis yes. So, if you were doing something\nwrong, let's say that they picked up in\nreal time with your transactions that\nimpacted your social score, could they\ngo ahead and freeze your spending? Or\ncould they program the bank reserves\ndenominated in dollars in your account\nto be able to spend on things like soy\nlattes at Starbucks instead of buying\ndiesel fuel for your pickup? The answer\nis absolutely they could. And of course,\nif your account is at the Fed, like we\nsaid earlier, they're going to see all\nof your transactions in real time.\nThey're going to know every single thing\nyou spend money on. And this is, of\ncourse, going to give them a massive\namount of control. Oh, but wait, there\nis more. Let's assume the Fed did have\nall of the accounts in the real economy,\nthe retail, the bank, the non-bank\naccounts on their balance sheet. Well,\nwhat this allows them to do is extend\ncredit to whomever they want. They don't\nhave to worry about being paid back. Why\nis that? Because if all the dollars are\non their balance sheet, when they have\nto transfer those dollars, they're\nsimply transferring them from one\naccount to the other. Whereas, if they\nwere a normal bank like this guy over\nhere, if a customer wanted to transfer\nthose dollars to another bank, then they\nwould have to take that liability,\ntransfer it to another bank, and they\nwould have to take an asset and transfer\nit to another bank. But in this\nscenario, the Fed literally wouldn't\nhave to have any assets whatsoever. So\nthis would a allow them to quote unquote\nprint money where right now they control\nbase money but in this scenario they\nwould control broad money as well and b\nit allows them to control credit in the\nreal economy because they can lend they\nthe central planners can lend to\nindividuals or entities that have\npolitical favor. They can lend based on\na narrative not based on whether or not\nthey're going to be paid back. So the\nmain takeaway for step number one is\nregardless of what you want to call this\ndollar denominated liability on the\nFed's balance sheet, you can call it a\nbank reserve, you can call it a dollar,\nyou can call it money, at the end of the\nday, it's really a central bank digital\ncurrency. Step number two, now that we\nunderstand the plumbing and the\nmechanics behind a CBDC, let's go into\nthe details of what Trump is trying to\ndo right now. You've all heard of the\nbig beautiful bill that they're trying\nto pass right now. But what you might\nnot have heard of is part of that bill\nis something called Trump Accounts.\nLet's go right over to Yahoo Finance and\ngo over this article here. The title,\nTrump Accounts for Newborns Pass the\nHouse. Here's why financial experts\ndon't like that. Okay, of course Yahoo\nis going to have a a negative Trump bias\nhere. We're not interested in the bias.\nWe're just interested in exactly what\nthese Trump accounts are. Says pretty\nsoon, every newborn American could be\nthe proud owner of their very own Trump\naccount. The Republican party's one big\nbeautiful bill, which passed the House\nearly Thursday. This was last week.\nContains a pilot program that would\nautomatically\ncreate. Notice I said\nautomatically create one of these\naccounts for a newborn child and they\nwould put\n$1,000 in this account. Now, I know a\nlot of you are saying, \"Well, Georgia,\nthat sounds like a great idea. Why\nshould we be concerned about this? This\nhas nothing to do with a a CBDC. They're\nnot saying that they're going to fund\nthe account with 1,000 Trump coins or\n1,000 Fed coins. And that's a very good\nobservation, but we're not done yet.\nLet's keep going through the article\nhere. They highlight the fact the\ngovernment will create an account\nautomatically and notify the individual\nparents. So, if you have a kid tomorrow\nand you don't even have to go down to\nyour local bank, the government will\nactually set up that account for your\nchild and deposit $1,000 in the account.\nAnd then you can go ahead and deposit, I\nthink it's up to $5,000 a year tax-free\nand let it grow. By the time they're 18,\nthey can pull out the money, then they\nhave to pay the capital gains tax. But\nwhat I really want to emphasize is the\ngovernment setting up these accounts\nautomatically for you. So think about\nthis. Does the government have access to\nyour banking details? Do they know that\nyou have a bank account at Wells Fargo\nor Bank of America? How exactly are they\ngoing to automatically set up this\naccount? And where is the account going\nto be for your newborn child? More on\nthat in just a moment. Another thing I\nwant to highlight is right here where it\nsays the money can grow tax-free until\nit's withdrawn. That makes sense, but it\nmust be invested in a broad stock\nindex. So what the government is doing\nis they're giving you quote unquote free\nmoney just as long as you invest it in\nthe stock market. And this is happening,\nlet's just say, three to four million\ntimes per year because that's roughly\nhow many babies are born in the United\nStates. Now, let's go over some slides\nthat I used for my presentation at Rebel\nCapitalist Live this past weekend. So,\nmain takeaway here with Trump accounts,\nit applies to every baby that's born\nafter January 1st,\n2025. The government funds it with\n$1,000. the Treasury or the government\nautomatically sets up the account for\nyou. So, there's automatic enrollment,\nlet's say, and it's only invested in\nstocks. So, the first thing I'm sure a\nlot of you are thinking about is, okay,\nwell, it has to be invested in stocks.\nWhat does that mean? Okay, well, if\nthere's three million babies born a year\nand the government funds this with\n$1,000, they have to buy the S&P 500,\nlet's say. That means there's an\nadditional $3 billion a year that's\nbeing funneled into the asset bubble\nthat already exists. But now let's get\nback to how this actually sets up the\ninfrastructure for a central bank\ndigital currency. So we've got the\nTreasury. They're going to issue a bond,\na Treasury note, whatever it is, or\nthey're going to tax. That's how they're\ngoing to get the $1,000 to begin with.\nSo that money goes into the Treasury.\nThen it goes to the Treasury's account.\nWell, where is their account? Ah, that's\nright. It's at the Federal Reserve. It's\ncalled the TGA, the Treasury General\nAccount. And after doing further\nresearch, I found that these automatic\naccounts that are being set up for the\nnewborn babies by the government and the\nTreasury are actually sub accounts of\nthe TGA.\nSo now let's go ahead and connect the\ndots. So every single newborn baby is\neffectively going to have an account set\nup for them at the Federal Reserve where\nthe money in that account is going to be\na liability of the Fed. In other words,\na central bank digital currency. But I'm\nsure there's still a lot of people right\nnow that are watching this video and\nsaying, \"Oh, George, that's not a\ncentral bank digital currency.\" Trump\nisn't setting this up to monitor us, spy\non us, have programmable money, a social\nscore. And I'm not saying that Trump is\nintentionally doing this. I think it's\ncompletely accidental. And he's\ninadvertently doing this. Why? Because\nhe doesn't understand the mechanics. But\nlet's just assume for a moment your\nposition is even if all these newborn\nbabies and non-bank entities in the real\neconomy have accounts at the Federal\nReserve, it still doesn't give them the\ncontrol that a central bank digital\ncurrency would give the central\nplanners. Let's go back in time to\ncommunist Russia. Now back in communist\nRussia, they had one bank. It was called\nGaz Bank. So the system they set up was\na system that's referred to as a single\ntier banking system. In other words, all\nthe local banks are just extensions of\nthe central bank. There's only one\nbalance sheet. There's only one ledger.\nSo the technical definition here is a\nsingle tier banking system is a policy\nframework under which all credit\ninstitutions coexist without distinction\nabout the quality of their\nliabilities. Exactly what we were\ntalking about in step number one. Or in\nother words, there is no distinction\nbetween central bank money and broad\nmoney. And quick FYI, it says this\nsetting is generally associated with\ncommunist economies. So now let's go\ninto how the Soviet state actually used\nGau bank. The Soviet state used the\nstate bank primarily as a tool to impose\ncentralized control upon industry in\ngeneral. Starts to sound like a CBDC,\ndoesn't it? using bank balances and\ntransaction histories to monitor the\nactivity of individual concerns and\ntheir\ncompliance. The state bank never acted\nas a commercial bank aiming at profit\nbut purely as an instrument of\ngovernment policy. Instead of\nindependently and impartially assessing\nthe creditworthiness of a borrower, Gau\nbank would provide loan funds to\nindividuals, groups, and industries as\ndirected by the central government. So,\nas most of you can tell, a CBDC really\nisn't anything new. They had it in\ncommunist Russia, but was it called\nFedcoin? Was it called Soviet Coin? No,\nof course not. Why were they able to\nachieve all these things that a\nmodern-day central bank digital currency\nwould achieve? Because they only had one\nbalance sheet. They only had one ledger.\nIn other words, all of the accounts for\nindividuals and entities in the economy\nwas on Gau bank's balance sheet. This is\nwhat gave them the power, the control to\nimplement what is basically a social\nscore to control people, to monitor\nthem, to intrude on their privacy, and\nto extend loans based on narrative, not\nbased on\ncreditworthiness. And like I said\nearlier, regardless of Trump's\nintention, and let me be very clear, I\ndo not think his intention is to do\nthis. I think it's inadvertent and\naccidental. But if we have all of these\nnon-bank entities in the real economy\nthat now have accounts with the Fed,\neven if it isn't called Fedcoin or even\nif it isn't called a\nCBDC, it's still a\nCBDC. Step number three. So, here is\nwhat you have to know.\nThis is not a central bank digital\ncurrency. It's not a currency unit that\nis going to be competing with the United\nStates dollar. This is a central bank\ndigital currency which would lead to all\nof these things that we don't want. So\nthe solution here is actually very\nsimple. In terms of money, we want more\ndecentralization. We don't want more\ncentralization.\nSo if you see our currency units,\nregardless of what we're calling them,\nbecoming more and more centralized, you\nknow, that's taking us closer and closer\nto this basically tyranny and\nauthoritarianism. So what we want to\ngravitate towards, and editor, you can\nhelp me out right here, is\ndecentralized money. And I know a lot of\nyou right now are probably saying,\n\"Well, that's Bitcoin.\" And I totally\nagree. This is why I love Bitcoin. Not\nbecause the number goes up, but because\nit's decentralized. And if\ncentralization takes us towards tyranny,\nthen by definition,\ndecentralization takes us towards\nfreedom and liberty. And by the way,\nwhenever the government offers you free\nmoney, regardless of whether Trump is in\noffice, Biden, Obama, Camala, Bush,\nwhoever it is, I would strongly suggest\nyou look at that with a very healthy\ndose of skepticism.

      "content": "Hello fellow rebel capitals. Hope you're\nwell. So I wanted to do a video and\ndebunk one of the greatest myths in\neconomic history in my view. But there's\na lot of things like this. I think the\noverall message of this video should be\nthat we can't just accept everything\nthat is said over and over and over and\nover and over again in economics is just\ntrue. Sometimes we got to use some\ncommon sense. We got to look at the\ncharts. We got to look at the data and\nsay, \"Hey, does this make sense?\" And if\nit doesn't make sense, we've got to\nscratch beneath the surface and figure\nout why. Um, some of those sacred cows,\none that we're discussing right here is\nPaul Vulkar broke the back of inflation.\nNo, he didn't. No, he didn't. Now, I\nthink Paul Vulkar was really cool.\nThere's no getting around that. You know\nthat image that you see of him smoking a\ncigar like doing that congressional\ntestimony. I mean that's proper\nbadass stuff right there. Can you\nimagine Jerome Pal doing that right now?\nOr Janet Yellen even better smoking a\nstogy in front\nof Chris. But uh in all\nseriousness we've got to we just can't\ntake these things for granted just\nbecause people say them over and over\nand over and over again. So, let's get\ninto it, guys. Let's go. Why do I say\nthat Paul Vulkar did not break the back\nof inflation? And if he didn't break the\nback of inflation, who\ndid? How on earth did it happen? Here we\ngo. So, I just did an article for\nSubstack. Now, believe it or not, we\njust started a Substack. I I haven't\neven talked about it really, but you can\nI think I don't even know if it's live\nyet, but uh now or in the future, you\ncan go to Substack and pull up Rebel\nCapitalist and you can see some articles\nI do. Now, I suck at writing, so I just\nuse AI to help me pretty much write\neverything. But um in researching this,\nI found out some things that I think you\nare going to find fascinating. So, first\nand foremost, let's go over to this kind\nof summary that I did with chat GPT and\nI'll explain it and uh go over kind of\nwhy what happened. Let's tell the story\nof Paul Vulkar. Now, when he got into\nthe Fed, it was like\n7879. What had happened with Arthur\nBurns prior to Paul uh Vulkar was they\nwere they weren't targeting a specific\nFed funds rate like they do now. That's\nvery recent. In fact, Greenspan, I\nbelieve, was the first one that started\ndoing that really in the late 80s, early\n90s. And we think that's just the way\nthe Fed operates. But that that's not\ntrue. What happened prior to Vulkar is\nthey were actually targeting a range.\nAnd they really didn't care if it was\nplus or minus about 50 basis points. So\nin the Arthur Burns area and I believe\nbefore the Arthur Burns era, excuse me,\nand before the Fed would sit there and\nmicromanage the amount of bank reserves\nand they thought this was actually\ncontrolling the overnight rate and all\nthese things because banks actually use\nbank reserves and you guys know the\nstory or you guys know how the concept\nworks, what they're taught in or what\nthey teach you in the textbooks. So if\nthe if let's just say the interest rate\nwas 5% they'd let it go up to 5.25 or\nmaybe down to 4.75 just anything that\njust fluctuated in there they'd just\nstand back and they just really wouldn't\ndo anything. A much more lazair\napproach. But what Paul Vulkar did and I\nthink he was heavily influenced by\nMilton Freriedman and the fact that the\n1970s had been a massively inflationary\ndecade. Let's not forget. So they are\njust trying to do anything. They're just\nthrowing anything up against a wall to\nsee what would stick because the one\nthing they knew they knew they had to do\nwas bring down the rate of consumer\nprice\nincreases. So Paul Vulkar comes in in 78\nor 79's like, \"Okay, well, we're going\nto take a novel approach to this. We're\nnot going to target interest rate or\neven a range of interest rates anymore.\nWhat we are going to do is target the\nmoney supply aggregates. More\nspecifically, we're going to target M1.\"\nSo Milton Friedman's sitting there\nwhispering in his ear. He's like, \"Look,\nif you're able to reduce the increase of\nM1 money supply, that's going to take\ncare of inflation. You're going to nip\nit in the bud.\" So what Paul Vulker did\nis he goes out to Congress. I think he\nhas a meeting with media and whatnot. He\ngets all of his 900 PhDs and says,\n\"Okay, this is what I want you to do.\nForget about these interest rates. We're\ngoing to let it swing wildly. If the\nmarket sets the rate at 3% higher than\nwhere we want it, so be it. We're going\nto get out of the way. We'll let the\nrange go up to 4% I think was the actual\nnumber he\nused. And then what we're going to do is\nwe're going to micromanage these bank\nreserves in order to reduce M1 money\nsupply growth. And that is going to\nbreak the back of inflation. This was\nhis plan.\nOkay, now that you know the\nplan, let's go over to kind of the\nsummary here and then I'm going to go\nover some charts as well, of course, to\nback up exactly what I'm\nsaying. So, by Rebel Capitalist News\nDesk, doesn't that sound official?\nThat's just You got to share your\nscreen, George. Sorry about that. that\nwhenever you see Rebel Capitalist News\nDesk over on Substack, if you guys want\nto follow us over there, that's just uh\nthat's chat\nGPT. That's George Gammon and chat\nGPT. Okay, let's get back to\nthat. So, here we go. Today, many people\nstill believe that Paul Vulkar, the\nfamous head of the Federal Reserve in\nthe early 1980s, beat inflation by\nboldly raising interest rates. This is\nthe story that all you guys have been\ntaught over and you hear constantly\nnonstop. Whether it's on social media,\nFinn Twit and financial media, it's\nalways Paul Vulkar broke the back of\ninflation by Jack. In fact, I've said\nthat on so many uh whiteboard videos.\nI've said that many, many times before I\nactually looked at it. I'm like, wait a\nminute. Did did he actually do that or\nam I just believing something that\neveryone tells me over and over and over\nagain? and assuming that it's\ntrue. So, uh, yeah, Paul Vulkar broke\nthe back of inflation by jacking\ninterest rates. He raised interest\nrates. He raised interest. He had the\nguts to do what it he had the guts to\nraise interest rates and cause a\nrecession. Okay, let's keep going. But\nwhat if the story is only half true? And\nthat's chat GPT talking. I would say\nit's not true at all. But uh what if in\nreality Vulkar didn't actually beat\ninflation, but instead got out of the\nway and let the free market do the work.\nSo this is kind of the punchline here.\nBut it wasn't his intention. This was\nnot his intention. This is why I don't\nreally want to give him any\ncredit other than for being a proper\nbadass smoking a cigar at all times,\nincluding when he's testifying for\nCongress. But here, let's keep going.\nThat that's exactly what happened.\nAccording to the careful look at the\nreal data, Fed's own meeting\ntranscripts. So I actually get into what\nthey were saying at the time. So the\nmyth is Vulkar heroically. Okay, we got\nthat truth and this is what I was\ntalking about here where he specifically\ntried to target\nM1 which was cash, you know, currency\nand circulation and demand\ndeposits. And they would do this by\ntrying to micromanage the reserve. So,\nas an example, if M1 was growing at 2%\nand like, oh, no, no, no. That's going\nto cause inflation. We want it to 1%.\nAnd let's just say they had 40 billion\nin bank reserves. They would go ahead\nand reduce that to like 35 billion\nbecause then and and now today, of\ncourse, you read in all the textbooks,\nyou've got a money multiplier. So if\nthere's this many reserves, then the\nbanks take those reserves and like, \"Oh,\ngood. This is fantastic. We can use this\nto create all these loans. And\ntherefore, however many reserves are in\nthe system, that's how much M2 money\nsupply you're going to have. That's how\nmuch M1 you're going to have because it\nstarts with bank reserves. Then the\nbanks can go ahead and lend off of\nthat.\" And it's completely\nreverse. But getting back to this here,\nthat's what they thought at the time.\nSo, they thought that if they just\nbrought the bank reserves down to 35\nbillion, then that would do the trick.\nThat would bring M1 down to 1% or zero,\nand that would go ahead and tame\nconsumer price\ninflation, they say. But here's the\nkicker. M1 growth didn't slow down as\nplanned. So, now let's go over to a\nchart of M1.\nAnd here we go. So, right around here,\nyou know, 78 79, this is when Vulkar\nstepped in and made that change. And\nremember what he's trying to do is he's\ntrying to slow the growth, if not\nflatline M1 money supply. And look at\nwhat happened. we go from 352 billion\nand in 1983 we're up to 480 billion.\nAnd by the way, if you want to know\nsomething really funny, this obviously\nisn't a log chart, but if you I did the\nmath and if you did this on a log chart,\nthe percentage change from\n1978 to 1983 when he tried to reduce the\ngrowth of M1 money supply by\nmanipulating bank reserves, the\npercentage increase was\nhigher was actually higher than it was\nfrom 1973 to 1970.\n78 in percentage terms. So, isn't this\njust\nquintessential central planning? The\nwhatever they're trying to do, they\nactually end up doing the opposite by\nwhatever policy they try to implement.\nAnd it's it's it's not just at the\ngovernment level. It's the central\nplanners at the Federal Reserve. Even\nPaul Vulkar, the man, the myth, the\nlegend.\nSo then you have to say, okay, well,\nPaul Vulkar obviously failed miserably,\nmiserably. Because even by his own\nadmission, this was his number one goal.\nThis was his objective is to get this\nblue line to go flat or if anything\nincrease at a slower rate than it did\nfrom 73 to 78. And what did he do? He\nactually well he didn't do anything but\nwhat ended up happening is the the\nreverse of what he was trying to do. So\nthis is an epic fail of all epic fails\nbut yet he gets all the\ncredit. He he actually did the opposite\nor the opposite actually happened of\nwhat he was trying to achieve and yet he\ngets all the credit for being a\ngenius. Now here's where I would give\nhim credit. Let's get back to it uh to\nthe substack\nhere. What he did is he said, \"We're not\ngoing to go ahead and target the this\nrange for the overnight rate. We're just\ngoing to kind of let it go free and\nwherever it goes, well, that's where it\ngoes. We're not going to add reserve.\"\nNow, they're going to add they're going\nto subtract and add reserves based on\nthe money supply, which failed\nmiserably. But what they're not going to\ndo is add or subtract reserves based on\nthe interest\nrate. So that's going to swing wildly.\nAnd actually, this is what explains the\nchart of Fed funds during this time. So\nlet's go back\nhere. I should have had this pulled up,\nbut I didn't. Here there's Fed\nfunds. So this is why I'm sure you guys\nhave seen this chart a million times.\nYou see these wild swings right here in\nthe Fed funds rate. And you're like, my\ngoodness gracious. It's like Donald\nTrump being at the head of the Federal\nReserve. It's one day it's 1%, the next\nday it's 5%, the next day it's 3%, the\nnext day it's\n12%. And uh this is why because he was\njust letting the free market figure\nout what the free what the uh proper\nrate of interest was. Now, this again,\nthis wasn't really his goal. He wasn't\nreally thinking about, oh, I know what\nI'll do. I'll let the free market work.\nHe's like, he just thought, well, let's\ntake our emphasis off of this and put it\nover here. So, what he accidentally did\nis he accidentally allowed the free\nmarket to take interest rates where they\nneeded to be based on all the other\neconomic\nfactors. And what did this do? Well, it\ndid a couple things. It sure as hell\ndidn't slow down money supply growth.\nBut this is where we get into some\nreally fascinating nuance and I I had no\nidea. But with the help of of chat GPT\nand doing the the deep research thing\nand spending a few hours on this, I\ndiscovered\nthat the the main reason why M1 and M2\ncontinue to grow, in fact accelerate in\ngrowth, is because you had a lot of\nforeign capital coming in. So you had\nthe Euro dollar system that was creating\ndollars and those dollars were flooding\ninto the United States most likely\nbecause the free market was taking up\ninterest rates so high you see. So not\nreally anything to do with Paul Vulker.\nSo what ended up happening is if you\nlook at credit creation and we're going\nto for a proxy here we're going to use\nloans and leases. So you see that from\nthis time loans and leases definitely\nwent up but it went up at a much slower\nrate starting in 80 or 79 called the end\nof 79. You see? So it's still going up\nbut if this was a log chart you would\nsee that it's going up at a much slower\npace than it was let's say right here.\nYou see? So inadvertently\nuh Paul Vulkar pretty much allowed the\nmarket to take rates a lot higher than\nthey were to the correct levels and this\nslowed down the credit creation along\nwith the recessions. Right? So you're\nreducing the supply side and the demand\nside.\nIn addition to this, because you had\nsuch high interest rates then that the\nfree market set, you had velocity of\nmoney slow down dramatically. Why?\nBecause instead of going out there and\nspending and spending now what people\ncould do or instead of buying stocks or\nwhatever it was or\nuh you know whatever they would do with\ntheir money, it was much better for them\nto put it in a money market fund because\na money market fund was paying them\nwhatever let's just say 18%. or\nsomething like that. So even though the\ninflation rate was very high, the fact\nthat they could get 18% like okay, that\nthat makes sense. So it\nincentivized savings, you know, the I\nthink the Austrians would kind of point\nthat out and they would be correct in\ndoing\nso. So the main takeaway here, the\npunchline is po Paul Vulkar\ninadvertently let the free market do its\nthing. The free market set rates where\nthey should be based on all the other\neconomic\nfactors. Then what happened is this\ndecreased\nthe credit creation growth from the\nbanks. This decreased velocity while at\nthe same time it incentivized new\ndollars coming in from the Euro dollar\nsystem outside of the United States to\ncome into the system and go ahead and\npark it in a money market fund or\nwhatever is because they wanted to get\nthose high interest rates paid in\ndollars as well. Which is why you see\ncredit creation flatlining or or or uh\ngrowing at a slower pace. But then you\nsee M2 and M1 growing at a much faster\npace. Now the Fed didn't do that. the\nFed's balance sheet was pretty much the\nsame. So, it's not like they were out\nthere buying um you know doing QE to the\ndegree to which would actually impact\nthose money aggregates directly like\nthey did during the surveys of\nsickness. So, Paul Vulkar himself gets a\nlot he gets all the credit. Is it\ndeserved? I don't think so. I'll let you\nbe the judge. He definitely failed at\nwhat he was trying to do. That's for\nsure. That's That's definitive. Oh, you\nknow what? There was one more thing that\nI wanted to go\nover. I'm glad I remembered this because\nyou guys hear me say on this channel all\nthe time that bank reserves really don't\nmatter. That the the banks don't really\nuse them. uh they they might now to a\ncertain degree, but especially back\nthen, and this is why the Fed's balance\nsheet really doesn't matter either. Now,\nthey can come in and bail banks out.\nThat's anti-inflationary. Absolutely,\nthey can bail out banks, and that does\nmatter, of course, like the BTFP, that\nthat definitely mattered, right? But\nit's not like we had a bank failure or\nbank failures in March of 2023 because\nwe didn't have enough bank reserves.\nthat that's that was not the problem.\nIt's that no one would lend to Silicon\nValley\nBank. And so when you go back here, you\nand this is the the whole idea, right,\nbehind QE that, oh my gosh, now the\nsystem is flooded with liquidity. So the\nbanks have all these bank reserves, so\nnow they can go out and lend as if\nthey're somehow constrained by bank\nreserves. That's not true. That's not\ntrue. And I always say this over and\nover and over again, but here is Paul\nVulkar basically saying the exact same\nthing. And what's amazing to me is no\none goes back and reads the\ntranscripts. No one goes back and does\nany of this research. I mean, it didn't\ntake you that long. Just took me a\ncouple hours. And especially now with\nthese deep research things on chat GPT,\nthere's no excuse not to do this stuff.\nSo, let's go back here. And what was\nreally interesting is in doing these\ndeep researches, um, they found quotes\nfrom transcripts from the Federation and\nfrom Paul Vulkar. I believe this is\nmaybe when he was testifying in front of\nCongress. Uh, let's see here. I know\nI've got them. Bear with me, guys.\nSo, here's um some quotes from a few\npeople that worked at the Fed. First,\nLyall Gramly are attempting to control\nthe money supply monthtomonth, which\ncan't be\ndone. I repeat, which can't be\ndone. What is he admitting? He's\nadmitting that the\nFed doesn't control the money supply.\nIt's the banks at the end of the day.\nIt's the banks. Like I always say, the\nFed is not at the center of the monetary\nsolar system. It's the commercial banks.\nThe central banks just revolve around\nthem. Paul Vulker himself admitted,\nthere's a quote from Paul Vulker. The\nrelationships that we look at all the\ntime between uh that we look at all the\ntime between liquid asset\ntotals and money narrowly or broadly\ndefined do not seem to bear the same\nrelationship to economic activity that\nwe might have anticipated. I find it\ndifficult or\nimpossible to explain that. Difficult or\nimpossible to explain that. And the\ntranslation here is they couldn't\npredict or control how M1 money supply\nbehaved and they openly admitted\nthat openly. In fact, this when Vulkar\nsaid that, I'm not sure if that was 82,\nif that was the bottom line, this was at\nthe early 1980s, the Fed was admitting\nthat they don't control the money\nsupply. They were openly admitting this\nin the\n1980s. But yet today, 25 years\nlater, we still are under the assumption\nthat they\ndo. And it's almost every single person\nin the mainstream media is under the\nassumption that the Fed controls the\ndollar, the Fed controls the money\nsupply when back in the they're flat out\nadmitting that they don't. They and\nVulkar himself admits that it's not just\ndifficult. It's\nimpossible to explain basically what\ndoes control the money supply. But\nobviously we know now that it's the\nbanks. It's the banks because they do\nwhat they want regardless of what the\nFed is\ndoing. But I do want to give Paul Vulkar\nall the credit in the world that he he\ndid have the guts to allow once he saw\nthe free market working with interest\nrates, he didn't step in and try to stop\nit. And he knew that that would likely\ncause a recession and he let it happen\nanyway. So I I want to conclude by\ngiving him a pat on the back and saying\nhe is the man for sure. For sure. But I\njust want to point out that when you\nlook at the details, he did not break\nthe back of inflation. He let the free\nmarket break the back of\ninflation. All right, guys. Enjoy the\nrest of your afternoon. As always, make\nsure you're standing up for free and\nliterally free market capitalism. We'll\nsee you in the next video."

      "content": "Hello, fellow Rebel Capitals. Hope\nyou're well. So, I just stumbled upon\nsome data that I found absolutely\nfascinating and it's making me challenge\nmy own framework and my own base case as\nto how 2025 plays out in terms of an\neconomic contraction, economic growth in\nthe United States. So, I wanted to\nquickly share that with you guys as soon\nas I could just go live here. And most\nof you know from watching my videos that\none of the things I really pay attention\nto is something called a near-term\nforward spread. Now, in doing so, I\nusually go to this website called\nnear-termforwardspread.com.\nAnd one of the main reasons I watch this\nis because the Fed themselves admit this\nis the spread sort of these esoteric\ninterest rate spreads they watch the\nmost and it has the most predictive\nability, the most predictive power. So\nlet's go over\nhere and look at what the near-term\nforward spread is doing right now. And\nwe can see I like that moving average.\nUh let's leave it there. So, it's still\ninverted. It has not yet uninverted. And\nwhen this thing uninverts, you know you\ngot a problem. Or at least you have in\nthe past. That's the stuff hitting the\nfan. But based on this 90-day moving\naverage, we have not yet uninverted. You\nguys can see it there, Josh. Hopefully,\nyou can zoom in as much as you can. I'd\nmove my my little arrow, but then it's\ngoing to get all weird. So, I wanted to\ncheck this out today to see where where\nit was, what was doing, and I noticed\nthis new link at the top of the website,\nperfectpredictors.com. Wow. Perfect\npredictor. Well, that's what I'm all\nabout. A a perfect recession\nindicator. So, I wanted to go and see\nwhat was going on here. So, and by the\nway, Snyder talks about the near-term\nforward spread quite a bit, and he is\nnot only a fan of it, but he's also a\nfan of the people that that put this\ntogether. So that being said, you know,\nI give a little bit more weight as\nopposed to just some random person on\nTik Tok or something like that that had\nthe perfect predictor uh the perfect\npredictor index and then they turned\nthis into a website\nperfectpredictor.com. So I wanted to see\nwhat was going on here. So I went ahead\nand clicked on the\nwebsite and here we go. It's very\nsimple, straightforward, just like the\nnear-term forward spread. Looks like a\nwebsite\nfrom the late 1980s or 1990s, excuse me.\nAnd the first thing it's just they've\ngot a link to the white paper, which\nwe'll go over here in a second. And then\nthey've got download\ndata, and they've got some\ncharts. The line that I want you to pay\nmost attention to is the blue\nline.\nAnd what they the the the short and\nsweet here is they took like\n685\nmillion inputs and put them into a\nsupercomput and then had the\nsupercomputer crunch these numbers to\ndetermine out of all these crazy spreads\nand derivatives and forward interest\nrates and Euro dollar curves and all\nthis stuff, did any have a\n100%\npredictive\nability. And the way the way they're\ndefining\nit, number one, was the predictive tool\ntriggered? And if so, did we have a\nrecession within 12 months? That's the\nparameters. That's how they're defining\na a perfect predictor.\nAnd then of course, does it have 100%\naccuracy going all the way back to\n1960? So if if if the the spread or\nwhatever the esoteric interest rate was,\nit had to fit into that bucket or else\nit was eliminated. So they used a\nsupercomput. I think it was something\nlike 800 GPUs. So for you tech geeks out\nthere, you'll you'll know what that\nmeans. And this is basically a chart\nsummarizing their data. So it goes from\nzero to one. And basically this is\nalmost like a light switch. So it's like\neither on or\noff. And when it is on it's at\none. So and again just let's focus on\nthe blue line.\nWhen this hits one, you get a recession\nwithin 12 months every single\ntime. That said, this perfect recession\npredictor was done in\n2024.\nOkay. So now, and this is just the\nentire website right there. Let's go\nover to the data. And it actually makes\na lot of sense. But when I first was\nlooking at this, I was like, h this kind\nof what are they doing here and how are\nthey doing this? But right here, you've\ngot the perfect 12 month and that's what\nwe want to focus\non. So this goes back to\n1961. And we can see that with the the\nperfect 12 months, this was not nothing\ngoing on here. It was basically at\nzero 0 0 in\n1962. Then we keep\ngoing\nand it's going to get triggered here\npretty\nsoon. I know. There we go. I knew I was\ngoing to go whizzing by it. So now it's\nmoving up. It moves up very quick. It's\nalmost like a light switch going from 0\nto one, but it hasn't hit one yet.\nNotice right here we're at\n69. And this would have been December\n16th,\n1968. Then what we do is it rapidly goes\nup and it is triggered. Well, this one\ndidn't rapidly happen, but it\nis. Let's see here.\nSo, this would have been\ntriggered or it wasn't\ntriggered. This one didn't get\ntriggered. Interesting. So, let's go\nback to that\nchart.\nH. Ah, there it is right\nthere. There it is right there. It\ndidn't quite get triggered. We got to go\na couple more months. And this is why\nthey use a moving average. So, that's\none thing I didn't tell you. Uh what\nthey do is they take they they took\nthese um indicators, you know, these\nperfect indicators, and then they\nsmoothed them out with a uh believe it\nwas a 90-day moving average, something\nlike that. And we'll get into the\ndetails here in a moment. And that's\nwhat gave them the\n100% predictive ability.\nSo, let's go back to this. And I'm\nassuming that if we keep scrolling down\nhere, we're going to hit it. Oh, there\nwe go. It goes to one. Yeah, sorry. So,\nwe go right here to\n69 and we're at one. So, now it has been\ntriggered. So, what this tells us\nis within 12 months we should have a\nrecession. So, we fast\nforward and there we go. So we get the\nrecession in 69 in December. You see\nthat's what this one indicates. So this\nis kind of how it works. This is\nbasically the source data for the chart\nthat we were looking at. So it's almost\neasier to look at this and then it goes\nfrom one and it starts going back down\nand then it goes down to zero again.\nNow, this is while we're still in a\nrecession and then we're out of a\nrecession and it's down to 0.9, but it's\nstill down from one. So, that's how this\nthing works. And what they did is they\nbasically and then of course uh it got\nit it wasn't down at uh zero too long\nhere because you can see the beginning\nof the 1970s it\nuh oh then it went back down to zero and\n71 and then the beginning of the 1970s\nyou guys know what happened around 74.\nI'm sure it gets triggered again if we\nkeep scrolling which boom there you go\nand it will go to one right here and\nthen when Oh wow that didn't take long.\nThis one was you went into recession\nwithin one\nmonth. That that timing was really good\non that one. It didn't take six months,\ndidn't take 12 months, just one month\nbefore we went to recession. You guys\ncan see right here. So this is how the\nindicator pretty much works.\nSo the punchline and you guys might have\ncaught this earlier is they did the per\nironically the perfect recession\nindicator in\n2024. So let's fast forward to see what\nthe most recent\ndata shows us and where we are today.\nSo, it was triggered right here. We go\nto\none in\nAugust of\n2023. So, isn't this\nincredible? when they\nactually did this report, it had been\ntriggered. But just let's just say 12\nmonths after they come out with this\nreport with the the the recession\nindicator that had a 100% accuracy. 100%\naccuracy that when this thing got\ntriggered within 12 months, you had a\nrecession every single time going back\nto the 1960s.\nBut\nnow, of course, once they release this\n12 months later, their perfect\npredictive\nindicator is debunked. Now, I'm not\nsaying this isn't powerful. Very\npowerful\nstuff, but it hasn't played\nout. So, something is broken. This is\nthe conclusion you have to come to. Now,\nyou guys know from watching my\nvideos that I get very frustrated with\npeople\nwho have a\nmodel of, let's just say, interest rates\nor the dollar. I mean, this this is the\nclassic one, right? They have a model of\nthe dollar that has been wrong over and\nover and over and over and over and over\nand over and over and over again. And\nthey never re-examine the\nmodel.\nNever. It's just the model hasn't worked\nfor 40 years.\nSo it just hasn't happened\nyet. And I think that's the wrong\napproach for me. If I have a model or a\nframework for the way economics\nworks and it's it's\nproven\ninaccurate, I'm at the very least going\nto examine\nwhy. I'm not just going to bury my head\nin the sand and say, \"Well, it just\nhasn't happened yet.\" Okay. Well, why\nhasn't it happened? I I want to\nunderstand this.\nAnd so I mean I did the exact same thing\nwhen I was on team dollar crash if you\nwill when I first started doing videos.\nI I saw the world through the lens of\nAustrian economics and most of the, you\nknow, influential people over there that\nare great guys and great friends. But I\nI saw the world the same way until all\nof the predictions, it's just the model\nis wrong over and over and over and over\nand over again. So, as an\nexample, every single thing that I\nthought would make the dollar go down or\ninterest rates go higher happened. And\nyet, the dollar went up and interest\nrates went\ndown. So, I I had to reexamine that and\nsay, \"Okay, instead of doubling and\ntripling and quadrupling down, you got\nto say maybe the model's wrong.\" And I\nfound out that back then the model was\nthat I was using was absolutely wrong.\nAnd that helps you\nimprove. So here I I don't know if the\nmodel is wrong, but I definitely need to\nreexamine for sure. I have to reexamine\nthis because what? And now let's\nactually go\nback\nto the report here that they had the\nwhite\npaper I believe. Here we\ngo. So this is November of 2024 when\nthis came\nout. And in this white paper they\nexplain how they did this. Now I I'm not\ngoing to spend a lot of time on this. I\njust want to give you guys an FYI,\nespecially those of you who are kind of\ntechsavvy, you might appreciate this.\nSo, they\nevaluated\n645\nmillion series using a supercomput with\n800 GPUs. CPUs, I'm sorry, GPUs. I got\nAI on the mind.\nCPUs operating in parallel and find 83\nspreads. So, these aren't the 2-year\n10-year. These aren't your typical, you\nknow, just inversion of the yield curve,\n3 month, 10-year, something like that.\nNot even the near-term forward spread.\nThese are are\nare very very esoteric. They're they're\nusing future rates. I mean, one of the\nmost powerful was the actually I've got\nit right here, guys. It's going to be\nfaster for me to look it up on my phone\nthan it\nis to find it in the\nreport. It was the uh spreads with a\ntime horizon of four years in moving\naverage and one year and then they\nactually did a one month as well. So,\nthey took starting on a 4-year horizon a\none\nmonth interest rate and I believe it was\non the one month T bill and then they\nwent out\nanother I'm not sure how long and then\nthat's that was the most powerful spread\nthat they found and it was with the I\nbelieve it was the futures contract on\nthe one month itself. So they took that\nout let's say two years three years and\nthen they tried to find where it first\nwould invert right meaning that the\ninterest rate 3 years out on the futures\ncontract for the onemon T bill would be\nlower than it is today you know\nsomething like\nthat so the the point here is they're\nnot just using the basic stuff that I\ntalk about all the time on my videos\nThey're they're using quite literally\nmillions of different little esoteric\nspreads you with\nderivatives and then they're plugging\nthat into a supercomput. This I I don't\nknow how you could do much better than\nthis. Unless you take this and include\nmaybe the non-farm payrolls, the labor\nmarket because that's one thing they\neliminate. I I read most of this. That's\none thing they eliminated right away\nbecause it didn't, you know, it was like\n60 70% accurate. So like, oh, that's not\ngood enough. But maybe it's something\nyou've got to take some real world stuff\nalong with the esoteric combine it and\nthat's the\nmodel moving forward. But my point\nis, if the\nsupercomput and every single crazy\nderivative got it\nwrong, something has to be\nbroken. Something has to be broken. And\nthis\nrequires further\nresearch by by yours truly before I can\ncome up with an answer as to why it\nbroke. And if I can't come up with an\nanswer as to why it broke, well then I\nneed to go ahead and re-examine\nuh or maybe reexamine my base case, not\njust reexamine the model.\nSo, I wrote down a couple of things that\nuh the first, you know, I'm racking my\nbrain as to what on earth, you know, why\nhas this taken so long here? Why why are\nwe already 2\nyears past? Well, I guess we're not two\nyears past it yet, but we're definitely\nover 12 months past when this should\nhave hit. You know, it should have hit\nby August of 2024.\nAnd as of right now, we haven't seen\nanything. And the first kind of idea\nthat popped into my mind\nis maybe maybe this is just all about\nthe global\neconomy. And it just so happens that if\nwe go back to now, I haven't backtested\nthis, which is what I one thing I want\nto do this weekend. And of course, I'll\nshare the results with you guys, but I'd\nbe curious to see if we were in a global\neconomy. Obviously, we were in the\nGFC.com 90s, 80s, you know, 70s. During\neach one of these recessions, were we in\na global\nrecession or was there a time there when\nwe were just in a US recession? My guess\nis they're all\nglobal or at least with the developed\neconomies. And if that's the\ncase, you couldn't necessarily say that\nthe perfect recession predictor\nindex was perfectly predicting the US\nrecession. It could have been just\nperfectly predicting the global\nrecession. And it just so happened that\nthe United States was part of that every\nsingle\ntime. But this time around, due to a\nvariety of different reasons, the United\nStates has kind of been an an isolated,\nyou know, they've been the\nstandout. They have been kind of, you\nknow, they're, you guys might not know\nthis because as an American, you focus\non the United States. It's what I do.\nBut if you look at what's happening in\nChina, if you look at what's happened in\nGermany, if you look at what's happening\na lot of these developed economies, I\nmean, you could easily say that they\nhave been in a at the very least\ntechnical recession. I think Germany has\nhad like 12 months straight of negative\nGDP. So, which would fall right in line\nwhen you look at the global economy.\nSure, that makes sense. and that would\nfall in line with this perfect recession\nprediction\nindex. So that that was and and looking\nat the Treasury curve would make sense\nbecause treasuries are basically the\nbond market for the entire world because\nthe United States dollar is a reserve\ncurrency. This is how the monetary\nsystem works. You guys know that from\nwatching my videos. So you can't look at\nthe JGB market and or the you know the\nAustralian debt market or something like\nthat and compare that to treasuries.\nIt's it's apples and oranges. So you got\nto compare the treasury market to the\ntreasury\nmarket. And since, like I said, it's the\nglobal kind of sovereign debt market,\nmaybe that's what we're seeing. And the\nreason why these spreads got out of\nwhack is because of the players in the\nmonetary system making\nbets on the global economy, not just the\nUnited States economy. Then the question\nbecomes, if the US has been involved in\nevery single one of these recessions,\nwhat are the probabilities that we\navoid going the way of Japan or Germany\nor China this time around? Probably\npretty low. I would still assume that,\nbut the timing can be all out of\nwhack. That's for\nsure. especially now with what's\nhappening with uh the tariffs and Trump\nand kind of the the disruptions that we\ncould see there. So, that was the first\npossibility that that came to mind and\nlike I said, I'm going to have to\nresearch this further over the weekend\nto come to some more definitive\nconclusions.\nThe second thing that came to mind\nwas could this be an indicator that is\nspot-on for\nrecession but over the\npast call it 8 months in the United\nStates we have actually been in a\nrecession but it's been a recession of\nthe 75%.\nAnd e even the biggest bulls out there\non finit or social media I think would\nadmit that the the um the middle\nclass has been in a recession for at\nleast 8 months which would line up with\nbasically August of 2024 right that 12\nmonth forward from August of\n2023. So the poor and middle class, they\nhave definitely been in recession.\nNobody is arguing that they're not\nstruggling. And so since this economy\nthat we have right now is so distorted\nand it's so warped in terms of the top\n25% maybe in the top 10% versus the\nbottom 90% because asset prices it's so\nheavily skewed. It it's just it's like\nthis inverted pyramid. That's the\nexample I always use that's just\nteetering back and forth and just that\nlast that single Jenga piece if you will\nis just asset prices. That's it. That's\nit. Where usually it's not an inverted\npyramid. It's like this where the\nfoundation is the real economy. It's\nproductivity. It's creating goods and\nservices. It's it's it's the real stuff,\nnot the financial engineering.\nSince it's like\nthis, you\nknow, back in these other time frames,\nthe\nrecession, the US economy would have\nbeen more reflective of what was\nhappening in the real economy as opposed\nto simply what was happening with asset\nprices and bubbles.\nAnd since you have that\nbifurcation, then you have the ability\nthat that additional purchasing power\nthat has been fabricated that at some\ntime, you know, those chickens have to\ncome home to roost, but they haven't\nyet.\nSo that artificial purchasing power that\nhas been propping up the economy and all\nthe players that are making these bets\non the interest rates, these esoteric\ncurves and what that that trigger this\nrecession indicator, they're basing\ntheir decisions basing their decisions\non what they see in the real\neconomy as opposed to simply basing\ntheir decisions on what they see in the\nS&P 500 or assets.\nthat. And again, I'm not saying this is\nwhat's happening. I'm saying this is\nanother hypothesis I have that would\nmake a lot of sense to me. I think it\nwould make a lot of sense to most of you\nwatching this video.\nThe next thing is maybe\nuh the labor market itself is broken\nbecause we have to ask\nourselves why is it that the NBER hasn't\ncome out and said that we're in a\nrecession. We know that the bottom 75%\nare struggling and for them it it sure\nas hell feels like a recession. Like for\nthem, just because the NBER or for most\nof you probably watching this video,\njust because the\nNBER hasn't clasn't said that we're in a\nrecession, you don't care about that.\nYour job opportunities are the exact\nsame as they were during the GFC or what\nyou see sort of standard of living with\nyour friends, your family members, your\nability to put a roof over the head, it\nis no different now than it was in, call\nit\n2009 or 2008. for you. We are living in\n2008. And just because again the central\nplanners don't come in and announce\nthat, hey, officially we've got the\nRword for you. It doesn't really matter.\nThat doesn't help you get a job. That\ndoesn't help you put a roof over your\nhead. You can't go to the grocery store\nand say, you know what, I need this\namount of food, but I can't afford this\namount of food.\nBut the NBER says that we're in\nrecession, so go ahead and cut me some\nslack. You know, that's not going to\nwork, right? The NBR, they haven't\nannounced it yet. So, hey, we're not in\na recession, so just pretend I can\nafford this food.\nSo, we've got two hypotheses. That's the\nright way to say it. Where you've got,\njust to reiterate here, so we're on the\nsame page. Number one, this is telling\nus about the global economy, not\nnecessarily specific to the US economy.\nNumber two, it's talking about the econ\nthe economy from a standpoint of the\nreal economy and the 75% or maybe the\n90% as opposed to the financial economy\nwhich is artificially propping up the\nnumbers as far as GDP. Number three,\nwe've got the the labor market itself is\nis just broken and therefore the we\nhaven't seen this explosion in non-farm\npayrolls which is what and the re where\nI was going with that is the NBER needs\nthat to you know put the flag in the\nsand and say yep it's official like\ngoing back to 2022 you guys remember we\nhad two quarters of negative GDP which\nshould have been a recession but they\nsaid, \"Oh, no, no, no, no, no. It's not\na recession because we didn't have, you\nknow, negative non-farm payroll. We\ndidn't have the unemployment rate spike,\nyada, yada, yada.\" But maybe it was a\nrecession and the labor market numbers\nthat we use are just completely broken.\nAnd it wouldn't be a shocker based on\nthe fact that the central planners shut\ndown the entire economy, the entire\nglobal economy, locked up everyone in a\ncage, destroyed global supply\nchains, gave out\nstemmies, said people didn't have to pay\ntheir rent, their mortgage, did all\nthese crazy distortions to the economy.\nWould it be any surprise that the result\nof those distortions would be that the\nlabor market data we have right now\ndoesn't really reflect everything that's\ngoing\non? Not my base case, but it sure\nwouldn't it wouldn't shock me. Another\nthing, my good buddy Mike Green always\ntalks about the\nuh gig economy and that that could be\nskewing the non-farm payroll because\ninstead of or the initial claims as an\nexample, because instead of making that\ninitial claim, you're going to choose to\ngo ahead and do Door Dash or Uber, Uber\nEats, something like that, where back in\nthe GFC, as you guys remember, we didn't\nhave Uber. That was not an option to\ndrive Uber. So if you lost your job, you\nhad one option and that was initial\nclaims. You would have been picked up in\nthe initial\nclaims. So another thing that I wanted\nto touch on is pulpit chart\nhere and go over non-farm payroll\nhistorically. And what you'll notice is\npretty much well almost every single\ntime we have a recession we get negative\nnon-farm payroll even headline. So I did\na a video on this the other day where I\nwent through the non-farm payrolls in\n2007 and 2008 the headline and we were\nabsolutely negative. So you can barely\nsee it right here, but that is going\ndown. Now I want you look you kind of\neyeball this and you see that this\nhappens every single time with the\nexception\nof with the exception of the\n197475 we had non-farm payrolls\npositive through about half of that\nrecession. They weren't even flatlining.\nThey were continuing to go\nup. So, this is kind of the anomaly.\nThis is the outlier here. So, could we\npossibly be seeing something like this\nnow where since you know the Fed started\ncutting rates or something like that? We\nhave seen a decline in the uh non-farm\npayroll but we haven't seen it go\nabsolutely negative. So could we be\nseeing something like this?\nMaybe. But then my question would be\nokay well then why is GDP positive?\nRight? Because you need the negative GDP\nalong with that softening in the labor\nmarket to have an official recession.\nSo then what I\ndid is I went back and I looked at what\njust as an example during the GFC at the\nend of 2007, the beginning of 2008, what\nnon-farm payrolls, excuse me, what uh\nGDP was headline GDP before the\nrevisions. So let's check this out right\nhere.\nThis is this came out this is the Bureau\nof Economic Analysis. This came out\nThursday, August 28th. So the economy\ngrew at an annual rate of 3.3% in the\nsecond quarter 2008 compared\nwith.9% in the first quarter. So these\nare their I think first round of\nrevisions. I believe they revised them\nthree times. According to the\npreliminary estimates released the\nBureau of Economic Analysis, the second\nquarter growth rate was revised\nup was revised up 1.4 percentage points\nfrom the advance estimate of 1.9. So the\nfirst estimate that came out was 1.9 and\nthen they bumped it up by 1.4 to 3.3 for\nthe second round of revisions. So you\ncan see how after this round we the last\nthe so fourth quarter 2007 was slightly\nnegative the first quarter of 2008 was\npositive and then the second quarter was\nlike blowout like wow look at this the\neconomy is\nbooming this in\n2008 so now uh let's go over to some\nother research I was doing with uh chat\nGPT here and pulling this up. I wanted\nto see after the NBER came out and\nannounced that we had been in recession.\nThey did this in December of 2008. Did\nthey revise them? Did the Bureau of\nEconomic Analysis revise? What happened\nthere? because we should have had or it\nshould have been a requirement that we\nhave negative\nGDP to trigger them saying that yes, we\nhad a recession starting in January\n2008. So it looks\nlike well this might be interesting.\nLet's go here first and then we can go\nback. So, revised\nestimates.\nOkay. I'm hoping we've got a chart\nhere. And if we don't, I'm going to make\nthis\nquick.\nBoy up.\nUm, okay. This is going to take too\nlong, guys. So, let's go\nback and let's click on\nthis. Here we\ngo. So, this is after one of the\nrevisions. Oh my gosh. This is from the\nWorld Economic Forum. Yikes.\nOkay. So it looks like the 0.9 now this\nmight not have been the final revisions\nFYI but it looks like the\n0.9 would have\nbeen revised at this point down to a\nnegative 1.8\nThat 3 point and\nremember the\n3.3 was a result of a revision\nupward from what was it\n1.9. It was revised upward by 1.4 and\nthen revised back down to lower than it\nwas during the initial\nestimate. And then we've got a negative\n3.7, negative\n8.9,\nnegative6.7. So you my point here, I\nthink you guys get it, is these\nrevisions to GDP can be absolutely all\nover the place. I mean, they can really,\nreally just who knows where they're\ngoing.\nSo I I think there is an argument a\nreasonable argument\nfor the fact that that we\ncould just be in this mode where the\nlabor market is skewed for whatever\nreason. You know, it's the labor market\nstatistics are\nbroken and you just get these massive\nrevisions after the stuff hits the fan.\nI'm not saying this is my base case. I'm\njust going through different\npossibilities that I've thought\nof. So to reiterate here, global econ\nthis this these esoteric curves and\nwhatnot could be predicting what's\nhappening in the global economy, which\nwould be totally in sync, could be\npredicting what's happening to the 75%\nof the United States economy, maybe 90%\nbecause it's just factoring the real\neconomy as opposed to what's happening\nin the financial economy. it's propping\neverything up\nartificially. Then we could have uh\nwhere the labor market statistics are\njust completely broken or we could be in\na 1974 type scenario where even going\ninto it the non-farm payrolls were\npositive.\nBut then what that would require, which\nwho knows what the probabilities are,\nbut it's definitely a possibility, is\nthat once everything's said and done, we\nget the GDP revisions going back to,\nlet's say,\nQ4\nof\n2024, and they're revised\nnegative. That's\nall I got. That's what I those are the\nonly reasonable conclusions I can come\nto as to why we haven't seen this play\nout. Um before I saw this data, I was\nlike, well, you know, it just takes a\nlong time. It took a long time uh during\nuh the GFC, you know, it was about two\nyears before the curve inverted and\nwe're a little over two years. So, it's\nall just part of the process. But but\nthat's just with kind of broad stroke\nanalysis like I do on this channel.\nWe're just kind of looking at things\nlike twos and tens, Fed funds and 10,\nyou know, three month 10-year and then\nlooking at like the near-term forward\nspread and some of these other things in\nthe labor market. But but this really\nchanges it for me because of how\nthorough this research was with all of\nthese interest rates that I believe are\na result of people making decisions with\ntheir money that have insider\ninformation. They have information that\nI will never ever ever ever or no one\nwill. Uh, no one on CNBC, no one in the\nFinancial Times, no one on Twitter. No\none has, we're talking about the\nFinancial Insiders like Buffett and\nTudtor Jones and um, you know, Larry\nFrink and people like that. They're the\nguys that have the insider information\nand the people running these banks in\nthe Euro dollar market and they're the\nones that are making the bets that\ninvert these curves and trigger these\nrecession indicators to begin with.\nLet's remember that the way these\nrecession indicators get triggered, the\nway we go from zero to one with this\nblue line is not someone just like doing\nthis. This is a result of people\nactually making bets with billions and\ntrillions, quite literally trillions of\ndollars. This is not just someone's\nopinion. This is not just someone\nranting like me on YouTube.\nThis is the the only way this gets\ntriggered is if people are making these\nbets with trillions of dollars, these\ninsiders with intel that you and I will\nnever be privy to are making bets with\ntrillions of\ndollars. So, this just doesn't happen\nout of out of this isn't a fluke. This\nisn't just someone saying that it should\nbe here. This is as hard of of of data\nas you possibly can have based on not\nwhat people are saying but what people\nare actually doing with trillions and\ntrillions of\ndollars. So that to me is the ultimate\nwe we cannot get a better recession in\nor any type of indicator than that. So,\nbut the last thing that I'm going to do\nis be stubborn about it and just\nnot revisit my own\nframework based on the\nfact that as good as the data is\nthere, we still as of right now haven't\nhad the NBER claim that we've been in a\nrecession and it has been well over 12\nmonths which based on that perfect\nindicator should have been\nimpossible. So for me, George Gam, that\nmakes me go back to the drawing board\nand say, \"What what did my model miss?\nMaybe I need to revisit this. Maybe I\ncome to the same exact conclusion I had\nbefore.\" But I have to have an\nexplanation for this that makes sense,\nthat isn't based on just\nsimply my bias or isn't just based on\nsome sort of narrative. It's it's\nactually based on factual information\nand mechanics of how the global monetary\nsystem actually works. So, I just wanted\nto share that with you guys. Uh, I\nthought it was interesting. Hopefully,\nyou guys thought it was interesting as\nwell and gives you something to think\nabout over the weekend. has definitely\ngiven me something to think about and\nI'm really excited to dive into this\ntomorrow and on Sunday to try to kind of\ncontinue to poke holes in my own theory\nand do some back testing on these four\nhypotheses that I shared with you\ntonight and may maybe I'll think of some\nother explanations uh that make sense.\nBut moving forward, whatever conclusions\nI come to or whatever I discover,\nobviously I'll share that with you guys.\nOn that bombshell, enjoy the rest of\nyour weekend. Make sure that you're\nstanding up for freedom, liberty, free\nmarket,\ncapitalism, and\nobjectivity, and critical\nthinking. And we'll see you in the next\nvideo."

      "type": "TXT",
      "content": "Hello fellow rebel capitals. Hope you're\nwell. So the big news over the weekend\nand today the United States gets its\ndebt downgraded. I think it was uh\nMoody's that came out. I mean this is a\nbig deal. You're hearing it all over the\nnews just repeated over and over and\nover again that the United States debt\ngets downgraded. This is crisis. This is\na this is a a catastrophe. And Moody's\nis finally acknowledging what we all\nknow that the debt is totally\nunsustainable. The deficits are going to\nblow out. The Fed is going to have to\ncome in and do quantitative easing and\nthat's going to make inflation just\nabsolutely rip higher. And the release\nvalve is going to be the United States\ndollar. So finally, finally Moody's is\nadmitting the obvious that this debt is\ntotally totally unsustainable.\nThat's the\nnarrative. So, and another thing that\nyou're going to hear, actually, you know\nwhat? Let's do this. I've got the screen\nshare. Instead of listening to me ramble\non, let's go right over to CNBC and\nyou'll hear from the professionals what\nthey think of the United States getting\nits debt\ndowngraded. Here we go. What Moody's\ndowngrade of United States credit means\nfor your money. So, we're going to go\nover what the normies are saying. We're\ngoing to go over what Zero Hedge is\nsaying. You know, the alternative media,\nif you want to call it that. And then\nI'm going to give you my opinion. We're\ngoing to connect some dots. And I'm\ngoing to tell you, well, I'll save that\nfor the end. I'm not going to let the\ncat out of the bag. So, Moody's\ndowngrades US credit rating, what it\nmeans for your money, key talking\npoints. Moody's downgrade could push up\nborrowing costs for consumers. You see,\nthis is always kind of the narrative\nthat you hear over and over and over\nagain. And it makes sense because, oh my\ngosh, if the United States is a bigger\ncredit risk, then these uh lenders that\nare lending the United States government\nmoney, well, they're going to demand a\nhigher risk premium, and that's going to\nincrease rates. Rates are going to be\nhigher than they otherwise would have\nbeen. And now because everyone sees that\nthe government is totally insolvent and\nwe have 200 trillion in unfunded\nliabilities and the deficits are going\nto continue to explode. Now that this is\nout in the open, then interest rates are\njust going to go higher and higher and\nhigher because these investors that are\nlending the US uh the US government\nmoney are going to\nrequire a bigger and bigger risk premium\nand then the United States going to turn\ninto emerging market. That's really the\nbottom\nline. From credit cards to mortgage\nrates and auto loans, here's how it'll\nimpact your\nwallet. The debt downgrade put immediate\npressure on bond prices, sending yields\nhigher on Monday morning. The 30-year\ntrade above\n5%. Wow. And the 10-year TR topped 4.5,\nhitting key levels at a time when the US\neconomy is already showing signs of\nstrain. Of course, that's all Donald\nTrump's\nfault. According to the mainstream\nmedia, bond prices and yields move\ninversely. We know that Treasury bond\ninfluence rates a wide range of consumer\nloans like mortgages as does the\n10-year. And Brian Reeling says, \"It's\nreally hard to avoid the impact on\nconsumers.\"\nOkay. So, Moody's dropped it\nfrom dropped it by one notch. Okay. In\ndoing so, it cited increased burden of\nthe federal government's budget\ndeficit, Republicans attempts to make\nPresident Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts\npermanent as though Biden had nothing to\ndo with this. Right. I I love that they\ncome out say and and look, I'll\ncriticize Trump where I think it's due\nand I'll give Trump credit where it's\ndue as well. But to sit here and say\nthat the the United States debt is\nbecause of Trump, I mean, come\non. That is completely\nlaughable. And I honestly, I don't know\nhow a media outlet could actually put\nthat in print and believe that people\nwould take it seriously. Like, they're\nreally going to say, \"Oh my gosh, well,\nof course, I mean, no one would ever\ndowngrade our debt, our our I mean,\nthese deficits would be at zero. We'd be\nrunning a surplus if it wasn't for\nDonald\nTrump. I mean, we probably wouldn't even\nhave federal debt. It would be at zero.\nWe' already have paid it off if it\nwasn't for Donald Trump. I mean, nobody\nis going to say that. Even the most Oh,\nI got a bug here. I hate that when I get\na bug in here. Anyway, uh but even the\nmost, you know, woke left, delusional\nDemocrat isn't going to say that, but\nthe mainstream media will. Or that's\nwhat they\nimply. When our credit rating goes down,\nthe\nexpectation that the cost of borrowing\nwill increase, said Ivory\nJohnson. And Ivory is a financial\nplanner, so you know that she or he or\nwhatever really knows their stuff.\nThat's because a country represents a\nbigger credit risk. The creditors will\ndemand to be compensated with higher\ninterest rate. You see, you'll notice,\nand I had a conversation with Snyder\nabout this this morning, which will be\nup on the Rebel Capitalists interviews\nchannel tonight, but their starting\npoint is\nalways that supply matters. Therefore,\nthese deficits matter.\nTherefore, if future supply is going to\nincrease, and this is what the downgrade\nof the credit is all about, then that\nmeans that well, interest rates are\ngoing to have to go higher and the\npeople that are lending the United\nStates money realize that there's going\nto be more and more and more and more\nand more supply of treasuries and\ntherefore those interest rates going to\ngo up. That's going to increase\nborrowing costs for\nconsumers and this is going to lead to a\nbig crisis.\nThis is the narrative. Now, before we go\nany further, I want to remind you this\nis not the first time the United States\ncredit or excuse me, the United States\ndebt has been downgraded by a credit\nagency. We'll get into that in just a\nmoment. Downgrades can raise borrowing\ncosts over time.\nAnd even the Atlanta Fed, Raphael\nBostic coming in and saying that he only\nexpects one rate cut this\nyear. Which consumer loans could see\nhigher interest rates? Again, we're\nassuming that interest rates are going\nto go higher. That this is\nthe You guys can see I get frustrated\nwith this stuff. So, let's just go back\nand take a a stroll through\nhistory. I forgot. I'm sure I've got the\ntab up here somewhere. looking for the\n10year Treasury\nrate and we'll just go ahead and pull it\nup.\nOkay, 10year Treasury\nyield. I visit it often, it says. Okay,\nthen we'll just go ahead and we're going\nto zoom out now. Let's go to some\nspecific\ntimes based on when we've had\nthese debt downgrades. That makes sense,\nright? Because I mean, if you listen to\nthe mainstream media, they make it seem\nlike every single time we've had these\ndowngrades, I mean, interest rates have\nskyrocketed because the United States is\na bigger credit risk and therefore this\ntime it's going to be the exact\nsame. So, let's go back to\n2010 and we'll zoom in.\nSo, the first downgrade was 2011, August\nof 2011, so right around here. And you\ncan see the 10-year Treasury yield was\ntrading about\n2.77%. Now, look at that yield\nskyrocket because of the downgrade.\nI mean, think about how much\nadditional in interest rate payments the\naverage consumers had to make because of\nthose interest rates\nskyrocketing because the debt was\ndowngraded. And you may say to yourself,\nGeorge, it doesn't look like the\ninterest rates skyrocketed. And you\nwould be correct because they didn't\nskyrocket, they went straight down.\nI mean just look at this chart and sh\nhow can you it's like so many things in\nmainstream finance and\neconomics is that that everything that\neveryone\nbelieves in the the the mainstream\nnarrative that everyone tries to push is\ncompletely\nabsent of just looking at a chart like\nin order to believe this. In order to\npush this, in order to buy this, you\nhave to ignore what prices have done in\nthe past. You have to ignore what the\nprice signal has told you. In other\nwords, you have to completely ignore\nwhat interest rates have actually done\nin the real world. You've just got to\nstay in your theoretical fantasy\nworld. And you say, George, well, that's\njust 2011. Okay, let's go ahead and\ncheck the next time the debt was\ndowngraded. That was 2023. I believe it\nwas August as\nwell. So, we're going to shoot over\nhere in\nSeptember,\nOctober,\nAugust. Uh, so we're right around\n4%. Right around\n4.05. Now, you just fast forward, I\ndon't know, a month or two. Do you see\ninterest rates skyrocketing?\nI'd like to remind you that two years\nlater, the roughly two years later, the\n10-year Treasury yield is trading about\n45 basis points\nhigher. Did it go up? Yeah. Yeah. And\nthen it came right back down. And I'd\nlike to point out that the yield was\ngoing up prior to the downgrade. It's\nnot like you had this downgrade out of\nnowhere. It's like, oh my gosh, these\nyields went from, you know, 3.4 straight\nup to 4.3 or whatever. No, they are\ngoing that direction. So, I think\nthere's a strong\nargument that the yield would have gone\nup over this little, you know, 3-week\nperiod even if it wasn't for the\ndowngrade. And then you see it fall\nright back down to sub4. And then you\nsee it bounce around, bounce around,\nbounce around. But definitely not a\ntrend higher after the downgrade. And\nobviously we didn't have a trend higher\nhere. We had a trend lower after the\ndowngrade. So why on earth people would\nassume this downgrade is going to be any\ndifferent. I I I don't know because you\nhave to ignore what happened in the past\nwhich you would think experts would not\ndo but for some reason they they make a\nhabit. In fact, that's what they're an\nexpert at is ignoring what has happened\nin the past because it gets in the way\nof their narrative. Now, let's go over\nto today because as you read in that\nCNBC article, they were talking about\nhow rates were skyrocketing this\nmorning, which they\nwere. And everyone on Twitter was\ntalking about the 30-year Treasury. Oh\nmy gosh, the 30-year Treasury is over\n5%. It's over 5%. It's over 5%. It's\nover 5%. What's the Fed going to do?\nThey've lost\ncontrol and it's only going to get\nworse. It's going to be this doom loop\nwhere rates are going to go higher and\nhigher and higher because of this deluge\nof\nsupply. Not only do we have the\ndowngrade, but now we're going to have\nScott Bent coming out. Now Trump is\ntalking about this big beautiful bill\nthat's going to increase the deficit by\n$5 trillion over the next two years.\nSo, here is what happened. This is a\n5-day chart of the 30-year\nTreasury. And you can see when everyone,\nyou know, got the news and then they\nwake up this morning, we start trading,\nit is absolutely true. Rates\nskyrocketed.\nThey went straight up to at one point in\nday. Let's just call\nit. Ah, well, let's just go to a daily\nchart. That's probably\neasier. And for some reason, I can't see\nit. Okay, we can eyeball it. Inday, it\ngot up, I call it\n5.05. And then what happened?\nWy Coyote all the way down\nnow to not just where it was this\nmorning, but much much much lower at\n4.90.\nSo once again they make the\nannouncement and rates pop and then last\nfor you know over the weekend let's say\nand during the open on Monday and then\nthey just right back down. So of course\nyou just get this knee-jerk\nreaction\nbecause of narrative you know oh my gosh\nthe debt downgrade the debt downgrade\nthe debt downgrade. So sell treasuries\nsell treasuries. So then of course what\nhappens is the banks see you selling\nthose treasuries and what do the banks\ndo? They come in, they say, \"Hit me, hit\nme, hit me, hit me, hit me.\" And do you\nblame them? Because the banks don't care\nabout the debt downgrade. They don't\ncare about the inflation rate. They\ndon't care about the fact that the\ninflation rate could be at 6%. Or maybe\neven going higher and\nor I think that is a correct statement.\nI'll go ahead and leave that for the\nmoment. But they don't care that\ninflation could be running at 6%. And\nthe 30-year Treasury is paying them 4.9.\nWhy? Because they're just simply\npocketing a spread. It's an arbitrage.\nThey're not using their own money. So,\nthey're just getting free money. So, I\nuse this example all the time on my\nvideos.\nI say if I gave you $100\nmillion but told you that if you take\nthis $100\nmillion next year the inflation rate is\ngoing to be\n6%. Would you decline the $und00 million\nand say no no no way I'm not taking this\n$und00 million? Are you kidding me? I'm\nlosing purchasing\npower. h how you're getting a free $100\nmillion and you started with no\ndollars. So the banks with the arbitrage\nplay, it's the exact same thing. So my\npoint here is it's a self\nuh equilibrating process where if rates\ngo up like this knee-jerk reaction, the\nbank's like, \"Hey, this is a better\ndeal.\" So if I'm a buyer here, well, I'm\ndefinitely going to be a buyer here. And\nusually it doesn't happen this quickly,\nof course, but over time, this is what\nsmooths things out to the point where\nthese movements are are really all about\ngrowth and inflation expectations,\nnominal GDP, whatever you want to call\nit. And they're not precisely pegged to\nnominal GDP, but the trend is there. So\nif you have nominal GDP that's going to\nbe declining over the next, call it 5\nyears, you're likely going to see\ninterest rates decline as well. Now,\nthey never decline in a straight line.\nThere's obviously a lot of noise. And I\nlike to remind everybody that during the\nGFC, in fact, let's do that. That'll be\nfun. 30-year Treasury. Let's just go\nback and see what happened in the\nGFC. We\nhad done\nseven. Let's get into 2008. Okay, so\nright here you barely see it on the\nchart. But at the beginning of 2008, as\nwe know, we were definitely in recession\neven according to the NBER, although\nthey didn't announce it until December.\nBut from January, we were at\n4.34. You go\nto another 6\nmonths and you're at 4.64.\nAnd this I'm sure there just a weekly or\nsomething like that. I'm sure intraday\nthere's a bigger than a 30 basis point\nmove. And the reason I say that because\nI know in the 10-year Treasury there's a\n100 basis point move.\nSo you have the these moves straight up\nfrom let's say January of 2008 to June\nJuly of\n2008 where everyone is talking about\ninflation risk inflation risk inflation\nrisk and two months later the Fed's at\nzero and 6 months later we're actually\nhave deflation because of the the\nbiggest deflationary recession debt bust\nfinancial crisis that we've had since\nthe 1930s.\n30s. So you see what I'm saying is you\ncan get it you can get this much noise\neven in something like\n2008 but eventually it goes back down\nand and look at the trend here for the\nthird year it's going straight back\ndown. If you look at GDP nominal GDP it\nflat lines kind of here but if you look\nat long-term trend it's this exact same\nthing. And then what happens to nominal\nGDP in 2020 when the government locks\neverybody in a cage and destroys the\neconomy, shuts down global supply\nchains, hands out free money, stemmies,\nnobody has to pay their rent, their\nmortgage. Well, nominal GDP skyrocketed.\nAnd then what do you think happens to\nthe 10-year Treasury and the 30-year\nTreasury along the curve? It goes up as\nwell. But when it's going up here,\nnotice it's not going up because of\ndowngrades. It's not going up because of\ndeficits. It's not going up due to\nsupply of treasuries. It's simply going\nup due\nto growth in inflation expectations. So,\ndoes that mean the the debt we just have\nthis get out of jail free card or the\ndebt doesn't mean anything or it's a\nfree lunch that oh well then if we don't\nhave to worry about interest rates going\nup then I guess we can just spend spend\nspend spend spend and George is all\nabout MMT. That's usually the conclusion\nthat a lot of people come to. Oh, well,\nGeorge is just MMT, so I guess we can\njust spend as much as we want to. We\ndon't have to worry about it. Screw\nthose consequences. We have a money\nprinter, and we know how that\nends. No, what I'm what I'm not saying\nis that this is a free lunch. I'm not\nsaying there are no consequences to the\ngovernment spending. There actually\nthere absolutely is, but the\nconsequences don't show up in the bond\nmarket. The consequences don't show up\nin higher interest\nrates. The cones the consequences show\nup in the economic distortions that the\ngovernment spending creates and making\nthe economy less efficient. So you still\nhave to pay the fiddler. There is no\nfree lunch. It's still going to\nnegatively impact the poor middle class\nand society at\nlarge because the government spending\nthat creates the deficit that creates\nthe debt to begin with by definition is\ncreating a misallocation of resources.\nIt's creating malinvestment and then\nthis in turn is making all of us poorer.\nThat's the punch line. And if you go\nover\nto the total uh government spending as a\npercentage of GDP, look at this. Look at\nI mean and this includes state and\nlocal, right? So you can see how this is\njust going up and up and up and up and\nup to the point in 2018 where we were\nabout 40%. I can assure you now it is\nway higher, way higher. In fact, I would\nsay it's probably near 50%.\nAnd as these deficits get worse and\nworse and worse, which they absolutely\nwill, I mean, trust me, I'm not\nsaying the deficits aren't going to get\nbigger, or that the debt is somehow\ngoing to shrink. Absolutely not. I would\nsay that the we're at 37 trillion right\nnow. I would not be surprised if in\nthree years we're at 50 trillion.\nWouldn't be surprised at all. And you\nknow, a lot of people are talking about\nthe deficits going to 8 n%. Forget that.\nI wouldn't be surprised they go up to\n12%, 15%. I wouldn't be surprised if we\nhave doubledigit deficits consistently,\neven when we're outside of recession\nover the next 5\nyears. But that doesn't mean that\ninterest rates\nexplode. That doesn't mean that we have\nbond vigilantes. It doesn't mean that\nconsumers have to pay higher percentages\nor higher interest rates. And you say,\n\"Okay, then George, what's the problem?\"\nBecause consumers are going to have\nshittier jobs because consumers are\ngoing to get poorer. So what if they\ndon't have to pay higher interest rates?\nTheir standard of living is\ndeclining. And that's at the end of the\nday the only thing that matters. And why\nis their standard of living declining?\nBecause of the government spending\nthat's creating the debt. So you have to\ncompartmentalize those things, right?\nThe problem doesn't show up in the bond\nmarket. The problem shows up in the\neconomy. And people get it backwards and\nthen they go so far as to say, \"Well, oh\nmy gosh, if we could just get the debt\nto GDP down, then it would be\nsustainable.\" How do you figure? So what\nyou're telling me is right now we're at\n120% debt to GDP. So let's assume we\nbring that down to 75%. Now all of a\nsudden we can just wave the flag of\nvictory and say, \"Awesome. Well, we've\ndone it. We did it. We tightened our\nbelt. We got that debt to GDP down to\n75%. And now the government can go ahead\nand spend like a drunken sailor again\nbecause we don't have to worry about\nforeigners buying our debt because we've\ngot a bid out there because our debt to\nGDP is so low. Is that you're going to\ntell me that somehow is beneficial to\nthe US economy? No. That just makes\nthings worse.\nIt's just like giving that heroin addict\na a brand new credit card. Does that\nmake it\nbetter? And all of a sudden, because he\nhas a credit card with a zero balance,\nno, it makes it worse cuz he's going to\nbuy more\nheroin. It's the exact same thing with\nthe US economy.\nSo, the main takeaway, at least my main\ntakeaway from Moody's downgrading the\nUnited States debt is not to point out\nthat we have a problem in the Treasury\nmarket and therefore we're going to have\nto pay more interest rates. It's to\npoint out and highlight the fact that we\nhave a problem with government spending\nand it's going to show up and it has\nshown up in the real economy which\nunfortunately disproportion\ndisproportionately impacts the poor and\nmiddle\nclass. All right guys, I'm leaving for\nOrlando tomorrow. Rebel Capitalist Live\nis this week. It starts on Friday. So,\nif you're in the area, if you want to\ntake an awesome trip, hang out with some\nincredible people, like-minded\nindividuals, and listen to some\nspeakers, rub elbows with guys like\nKiasaki, Brent Johnson, oh, Patrick\nFresno, Rick Rule, Mike Maloney. I\nthere's so many awesome speakers that\nare going there. And what's great about\nthis event is they're not really behind\nclosed doors. All the speakers are\nhanging out. They're in the crowd.\nThey're at the cocktail parties. They're\njust having beers with everybody,\nshaking hands, taking pictures,\nanswering questions. It's really a neat\nevent. And this event is going to be the\nbest one that we've done so far. I can\nassure you. So, you can get your tickets\nat rebel\ncapitalistlive.com. And on that\nbombshell, guys, enjoy the rest of your\nafternoon, evening. As always, make sure\nyou're standing up for freedom, liberty,\nfree market capitalism. See you on the\nnext video."

      "content": "Hello fellow rebel capitalists. Hope you\nare well. So we had Donald Trump come\nout the other day\nand\nstart the creation of an infrastructure\nfor a central bank digital\ncurrency. Now Sleepy Walrus here in the\nchat says, \"Why would Trump do a 180 on\na CBDC?\" I'm glad you asked. out of\nsheer\nignorance. And this is why I've been\npounding the table for the last two\nyears that the way we push back on a\ncentral bank digital currency is to make\nsure that we understand the mechanics\nbecause you've got guys like Trump and\nRonda Santis and Ted Cruz and all these\npoliticians that are saying they don't\nwant a CBDC, but they don't even know\nwhat it is. And therefore, as we can see\nTrump doing right now, he's pushing\npolicies that take us not only in the\ndirection of a CBDC, but like I said\nearlier, actually setting up the\ninfrastructure for this to come to\nfruition. So, let me do a screen share\nhere and I'll tell you exactly what I am\nreferring\nto. And Josh is MIA for some reason.\nJosh is on Tinder somewhere. Of course,\nwhenever he's not here, doesn't answer\nhis messages, that's what he's doing.\nSwiping right, swiping\nleft. Okay, but let's go. Actually, you\nknow what? Let's first and foremost go\nto right here. I want to make sure you\nguys can see this. And well, I'll assume\nthat you can. So, what happened the\nother day with the big beautiful bill is\nwe're getting closer to these Trump\naccounts going into effect. So, they\nwere called MAGA accounts, but now of\ncourse Trump being Trump wanted to\nrename them after his his after his last\nname, just his ego, whatever it is. So,\nthe bottom line here is he's putting\n$1,000 into every kid's account that is\nborn after January 1st, 2025, and I\nbelieve it's to 2028 or 2029. But you\nguys know how this works, right? If\nTrump starts this and every single baby\nthat's born gets $1,000 in an account\nthat's tax-free that the parents can\ncontribute to, what's going to happen in\n2028? They're just going to they're\ngoing to roll this over. They're not\ngoing to get rid of it. Like Milton\nFriedman says, there's nothing more\npermanent than temporary government\nprogram. And I don't see why this would\nbe any different. I mean, think about\nthat. If you were having a kid just one\nday past the deadline, would you be\nlike, \"Oh, shoot. That sucks. We don't\nget that $1,000 of quote unquote free\nmoney if you were a normie.\" Of course\nnot. You'd be like, \"Oh, we want this\nprogram to continue.\" Who Who's not\ngoing to be in favor of free money?\nEspecially now with the Republics being\nbasically socialists uh right along with\nthe Democrats. Maybe not socialists, but\ndefinitely central planners. They they\nlike big government. It just has to be\nbig government in their way. So anyway,\nyou can see all of these reports. Wall\nStreet Journal, we've got\nBloomberg. And to get the gist of it, I\nthink actually Yahoo had a report. And I\nactually used this for my presentation\nat Rebel Capitalist Live, which is kind\nof why it's topical for me. And we're\ngoing to go over to some of those slides\nfrom the presentation that I gave so I\ncan show you the back-end mechanics as\nto how this leads straight to a CBDC. I\nI'm not making up the title. I'm not\nembellishing anything. That's not\nclickbait. Wait till you see the\nmechanics. This is absolutely\nunequivocally what Trump is doing. And\nobviously it's inadvertent, right? I'm\nnot saying that he's secretly wants a\nCBDC. He's just too ignorant.\nJust like Dantis, just like all these\npoliticians that don't know the\nmechanics behind a CBDC. Therefore, they\ncome out and\naccidentally push policies that take us\ncloser to that endgame. So, here's from\nYahoo. I think this is what I use for my\npresentation. Trump accounts for\nnewborns past the House. Here's why\nfinancial experts don't like them. Of\ncourse, Yahoo is going to put this spin\non it because they don't like Trump and\nanything that Trump does, they're gonna,\nyou know, say that this is somehow\nnegative. And they don't like it for\ncompletely different reasons. Obviously,\nthey don't go into the mechanics and the\nand the whole, you know, Fed angle and\nthe not just the intrusion in your\nprivacy, but also in the future, you\nknow, once Trump's not\nthere, everyone having this bank account\nthat quite literally the government\ncontrols. So the mainstream media isn't\ngoing to have that angle on it. Okay.\nOriginally dubbed mega, we got\nthat. But financial advisors with Yahoo\nwarned uh free seed money blah blah blah\nblah blah. They say basically the reason\nthey don't like it is because it's\nsimilar to something that already\nexists as far as one of these tax-free\naccounts that you can put money into\nevery single year.\nUnder the proposal, parents will have\nthe option to open Trump accounts for\nany child under the age of eight at a\nbank of their choice. Oh, I didn't know\nthat. Oh, I see. So, they can open\naccount for any kid under the age of\neight, but the newborns are the ones\nthat receive the quote unquote free\n$1,000. Now, what's key is this next\nsentence. Listen to this very closely,\nplease. In cases where parents fail to\nset up an account for the baby, the\ngovernment will create one\nautomatically and notify\nthem. Now, I want you to think about\nthat for a\nmoment. Let's say you had a baby\ntomorrow and the government sets up an\naccount for that baby.\nWhere what\nbank is that? Bank of America? Is that\nWells Fargo? Is that JP Morgan Chase?\nWhat retail\nbank are they going to just\nautomatically set up that account for\nyour baby if you don't notify them? And\neven if you do, they're probably going\nto set up the account where they want to\nset it up anyway. So, the kicker here is\nthat account is set up at the\ntreasury. More on that in just a\nmoment. So, the parents can contribute\nup to $5,000 a year. Now, all of this\nsounds pretty good. Like, if you're a\nmega person, you're probably like, \"Oh,\nGeorge, you're just sour grapes. You're\njust you've got Trump derangement\nsyndrome. This is fantastic.\" just just\nsit back and bask in Trump's glory and\neverything that he's doing for the\naverage Joe and Jane. Why do you always\nhave\nto Why do you always have to look at the\nglass half empty? Just bear with me for\na moment. Just Just bear with me and\nyou'll see exactly where I'm going with\nthis and I guarantee you after the video\nis done, you're going to have the exact\nsame position as I do, assuming that you\nthink this is initially a positive.\nOkay, tax their cashed out. Investment\nreturns will be tax long-term cap gains.\nWe all know how these things work. Now,\nlet's see if they story continues. Okay,\nlet's do\nthis. Now, before I move on to my\nslides that go into the\nplumbing, I wanted to go over something\nvery, very, very important. And I don't\nknow if it's in this article or if it's\nin a different one. And if it's not,\nI'll I'll just simply\nreveal. I'll simply tell you. Okay. So,\nI don't see it here. But one of the\nother kickers here is when you put the\nmoney into the account or when the\ngovernment does it for you and sets up\nthe account, they actually manage the\naccount. And what do you think they can\nbuy with all the dollars that go in\nthere initially or the money that you\nput in every single year? There's only\none thing they can buy. And oddly, it's\ntreasuries. It's\nstocks. It's stocks. So, think about\nthat. We've got maybe three four billion\ndollars a year, and that's just in the\nin the thousand accounts that are being\ncreated, assuming there's three or four\nmillion babies that uh are born every\nyear. It's right about that. I I looked\nit up for my\npresentation. So, you have an automatic\nbid for the stock market. And of course,\nthis is going to go into the S&P 500\nbroadbased index. So, you're just going\nto have this passive bid that's\nsupercharged that's going to\nartificially take stocks higher and\nhigher and higher, you know, so Trump\ncan can claim that the economy is\nbooming because of the stock market if\nhe goes back to that narrative. And it\nit's just it's just\nmore it's basically the government\nbuying the stock market just to prop it\nup. Now, I don't think that's a good\nthing. Maybe you do, but more. But now I\nI wanted to get that out of the way\nbecause I think that's something that's\nvery important. But now let's focus on\nthe CBDC component of it. Let me go over\nto Yeah. Okay, cool. We're still still\ndoing the screen share. Let me shoot\nover\nto Josh. Can you see this? Because I had\nto do the whole desktop.\nYes. Can you just make it a little bit\nbigger? Expand\nit. Yep, that looks good.\nAll right, let's see. I'm\ngonna I I don't Okay, guys. Can you tell\nme in the chat? I'm assuming everyone\ncan see the slides. Can you not hear me?\nNo one can hear you. You've got your\ntender mute thing on.\nWe can see it. No, no one can hear you.\nSo, okay, we can see. All right, getting\nover to the slides.\nLet me go ahead and expand\nthis. All right. So, I won't go through\nobviously every slide, but what I want\nto do is I want to focus and my\npresentation was about it was about a\nlot of things, not just what we're\ntalking about on this video, but this\nwas a very important component of it\nthat I wanted to share with you as soon\nas I got back from Orlando. So, the\nthing the the main takeaways here from\nthe Trump accounts, it's born any baby\nthat's born after January 1st, 2025, I\nbelieve it's for three or four years,\nthey get $1,000 of quote unquote free\nmoney. The Treasury sets up the fund\nautomatic enrollment. That's very, very\nimportant. And it's only invested in the\nstock\nmarket. So, now let's get to the\nplumbing.\nWhat happens is the treasury will go\nahead and fund this by taxation by\nselling uh a treasury, let's say. So\nthat money goes to the treasury, okay?\nAnd then let's say $1,000. Then they\ntake the $1,000 and they're going to put\nit in their bank account, not yours,\ntheirs. And where is their bank account?\nWell, most of you know this from\nwatching my videos. It's on the Fed's\nbalance sheet. It's a liability of the\nFederal Reserve. what's called the TGA,\nthe Treasury General account. So, what\nthey do is they set up a sub account of\ntheir account at the Fed. So, they've\ngot the TGA and now the TGA is going to\nhave all of these sub accounts, millions\nand millions of sub accounts. And I just\nhighlighted this or I shaded this in\ndark gray for baby XYZ just to show you\nthat baby XYZ that was born, you know,\ntomorrow or whatever or today, they now\nhave an account basically at the Fed\nbecause it's a sub account of the TGA\nand the TGA is a liability of Jerome\nPowell.\nNow, let's take it another step because\nI know a lot of people would say, \"Well,\nthis is probably never going to fly long\nterm because it's going to increase the\ndeficit. It's going to increase the\ndebt.\" And Trump, so he says, is all\nabout reducing the deficit. You know,\nthat's actually not a problem when you\nlook at the plumbing. We go to the next\nslide. So, what they can do, and I think\nthey'll probably do this in the future\nwith UBI. Um, a lot of this presentation\nwas based on artificial intelligence and\nhow I think the government Trump is\ngoing to implement UBI for the job\nlosses. But that's a topic for a\ncompletely separate video. But even if\nthey wanted to implement UBI or these,\nyou know, the thousand baby accounts by\nnot issuing bonds, uh, the Treasury\ncould simply issue coinage. I know this\nis kind of a wonky type of idea, but it\nwould actually work. And it's Paul\nKrugman. remember he came up with the\nidea of the trillion dollar platinum\ncoin. Now, I'm not saying I would be in\nfavor of this, but it would work. It's\nlegal. And um what happens is instead of\nthe the treasury taxing or selling a\ntreasury a bond and collecting that uh\nfrom the\num let's just say the average Joe and\nJane or from the real economy and then\nputting that in their Fed account for\nbaby XYZ or for your UBI in the future.\nThey just simply mint the coin and\nthat's the asset on the Fed's balance\nsheet that would be the offsetting asset\nto the liability they created by putting\nmore currency units into the TGA whether\nit was a TJ or the TJ sub account. It's\nthe exact same thing. And this would uh\neliminate the need to sell the debt. So\nyou could do this, you could do UBI. In\nfact, you could pretty much do anything\nyou wanted without having to issue any\nmore treasuries and therefore not\nincreasing the deficits or the overall\nUS debt. So, if you came in like a debt\nsealing issue, it it's it's it's no big\ndeal. Uh I'm not saying they're going to\ndo this, but they easily easily could.\nAnd things got so crazy during the\nsurveys sickness as far as the financial\nengineering. I mean, think about this.\nIf I would have been doing these videos\nback in 2006 and I would have been\ntalking about quantitative easing, how\nthe Fed can just buy all these\ntreasuries and increase their balance\nsheet to 10 trillion or whatever it is,\nmost people would have said, \"Oh,\nGeorge, that's absolutely crazy. There's\nno way they're ever going to do that.\"\nIn fact, you probably would have said\nthere's the same probability of them\ndoing quantitative easing as the\nTreasury minting a trillion dollar\nplatinum coin.\nSo, I think everything should be on the\nbingo card right now. But the main point\nis going back to the\noriginal slide or the original slide of\nthe plumbing that shows you that every\nsingle one of these accounts that are\nautomatically going to be set up for the\nbabies. They're going to be accounts at\nthe Treasury and their account is at the\nFed. In other words, every single one of\nthese accounts is going to be a sub\naccount of the Federal Reserve. It's\ngoing to be a liability of the Fed. And\nyou guys know from watching my videos\nand and you know that I've just been\npounding the table on this for the last\nprobably two years saying that, okay,\nit's great that the Republicans don't\nwant a CBDC. It's great that Dantis and\nTom Cruz and Donald Trump are talking\nabout this, but they have to understand\nthe\nmechanics. And it's obvious they don't\nbecause if they did understand the the\nmechanics, they would know that a CBDC\nis not something that competes with the\ndollar. That's complete nonsense. A CBDC\nis simply or to you know, you know, what\ndoes a CBDC allow the government to do?\nBecause at the end of the day, the\ncurrency units that we have outside of\npieces of paper, they're just\nliabilities of the banking system and\nall these banking systems are are all\nthese banks. They just have balance\nsheets that are connected. Just like a\nnetwork of banking balance sheets,\nthat's all money or the monetary system\nat the end of the day really\nis. So, a CBDC is when you just have all\nof those ledgers or all of those balance\nsheets merged into one balance sheet\nthat the government\ncontrols. It was just like Gau bank back\nin Russia in in communist Russia. It's\nthe same thing. There was one central\nbank and those were all of the banks. It\nwas all just one bank. So, if you look\nand see what Gau bank was able to do,\nit's the exact same thing as what the\ngovernment could do in the future if\nthey had a CBDC as far as they would\nknow every single one of your\ntransactions. They could give you a\nsocial score, which is basically what\nthey had in communist Russia, by the\nway. And they could go ahead and issue\ncredit not based on merit, but based on\npolitical narrative. And again, that's\nwhat they did in communist Russia. So if\nyou had some political insight or\ninsight, uh if you had a an insider\nrelationship, let's say, with the\npolitical class, then you would go ahead\nand you would most likely get that loan\nfrom Gazbank, where someone that had a\nmuch better idea and had a higher\nlikelihood of paying them back probably\nwouldn't get that loan. You see why?\nBecause Gau Bank can't go out of\nbusiness. It's not possible because they\nnever ever ever have to transfer a\ndeposit\nliability. If there's just one bank in\nthe system, it can't go bust. It It's\nagain, it's not possible. So, with the\nFed, that's one main reason why the Fed\ncan't go bust and why they can have\nnegative equity and why they never have\nto worry about\nthat. It's because they never have to\ntransfer those deposit liabilities\noutside of their balance sheet. it just\ngoes from one account to the other. So\nbasically they become like a\nscorekeeper.\nSo, just to reiterate, the point is if\nwe allow retail accounts, which by the\nway, I don't even know how they're\ngetting away with this because the they\nhave to have some legal loophole that\nsays that these sub accounts are\ntechnically accounts of the Treasury\nbecause right now the Federal Reserve\nAct, not that anyone pays any attention\nto that, including the central planners,\nbut the central uh excuse me, the uh\nFederal Reserve Act, it explicitly says\nthat it is illegal for the Fed to have\nretail accounts. Illegal to have for the\nFed to have non-bank retail accounts,\nand that's exactly what this is. It's\nexactly what it is.\nSo, just so we're all on the same\npage, the more retail accounts the Fed\nhas on their balance sheet, whether it's\nbecause of uh Trump accounts or whether\nit's because of UBI or anything else,\nthe closer we are to a\nCBDC. And once and in fact, if you have\na baby that has a Trump account, then\nthose dollars in that account, that is a\nCBDC. That is absolutely unequivocally a\nCBDC. And if next, let's say Trump is\nout of office and the next time that we\nhave something that's in play that you\ndon't like that you express your\ndissatisfaction on Twitter or whatever\nit is, then you don't think the\ngovernment's going to be that is going\nto uh freeze that account. Of course\nthey are. Look at the truckers in CA in\nCanada. They got all their accounts\nfrozen. And it's going to be even easier\nfor them to do it in the future because\nthey don't even have to go through the\nbanking system. It's all inhouse. It's\nall under the same central planner\nauthoritarian umbrella. They'll know\nevery single one of your transactions.\nSo, if you had one of these Trump\naccounts and you I don't even know if\nyou could because it's managed for you,\nbut let's say that you deposit $5,000 in\nthere. Okay, that the government is\nimmediately in real time going to know\nany one of your transactions and let's\nsay in the future you can just go ahead\nand use this account as a normal bank\naccount and you can buy groceries, you\ncan go to Chipotle, you can pay your\nrent that the government is going to\nknow this in real time where now at\nleast if they want that information they\nhave to go through the banks that have\nthat and then they have to I'm sure\nsubpoena the banks and they have to go\nthrough a legal process.\nin order to get this, but they can't get\nit in real time. Here, they're going to\nbe able to get that in real time, and\nthen they're going to be able to\nmicromanage your life. They're going to\nbe able to give you the social score if\nyou spend too much on gas or beef or\nwhatever it is. Then, of course, they're\ngoing to be able to cut off your\nspending and they're going to be able to\njust they're the puppeteer. They're the\nfinancial economic puppeteer. It's\ncentral planning 101. It's a central\nplanner's wet dream.\nAnd Trump, I don't think he even knows\nthis. I would be shocked if he\nunderstood the plumbing. I don't think\nany of the Republicans do because they\nhaven't taken the time to go through and\nthink about this and say, \"Actually,\nwhat is a\nCBDC?\" Because they all think it's just\nthis weird Fedcoin thing that's going to\nsomehow be denominated in Fedcoins and\nwe're going to use this as an alternate\nform of currency or some that's just\nnonsense. Nonsense. Just remember if the\nif you can remember one thing from this\nvideo, it's a CBDC is nothing more than\nan a liability of the Federal Reserve.\nThat's it. That's a CBDC. So if you have\nan account in the future that's not a\nliability of Wells\nFargo or Bank of America or XYZ retail\ncommercial bank and it's and you find\nout that it's one of these sub accounts\nof the Treasury, you've got a CBDC, my\nfriend.\nSo, we have to be aware of the mechanics\nand we we have to push back against\nthis. I don't know what on earth I would\ndo if I was a parent and I got the I\nwould try to take the $1,000 out of the\naccount and try to send it to Bank of\nAmerica. And if I couldn't do that, I'd\njust let it go. There's no way. I would\njust let it be. And in 18 years or\nwhatever it was when I could withdraw\nthe money, I would immediately and put\nthat into a commercial account. But the\nlast thing I would ever do is take my\ndollars from the commercial banking\nsystem and deposit it and basically turn\nthem into a CBDC for the\ngovernment to use against me in the\nfuture. This is complete insanity. And I\nthink it really highlights why it's so\nimportant to really understand the\nback-end plumbing if you're someone that\nreally\nvalues freedom and privacy. I remember\nwhen I first started talking about this\nand people were giving me a hard time\nlike, \"Oh, George, you're just splitting\nhairs. It it's it's no big deal. This is\nIt doesn't matter if Dantis or Trump if\nthey don't understand the backend\nplumbing of this. I mean, give me a\nbreak. You're just trying to create\nvideos to get clicks. I'm like, \"No, no,\nthat's not it. It's not it.\" Because if\nthey don't understand, they're going to\ndo stupid stuff like this where we wake\nup one day and we're like, \"Oh, wow.\nI've got a social score. How did that\nhappen? Nobody told me we have a CBDC.\"\nAnd it's because you don't understand\nthat you've been depositing money in\nyour sub account at the treasury that\nthat is a CBDC. And now all of a sudden\nyou're using it as though it's your\nnormal bank account because they're\npaying you a higher interest rate\nbecause why wouldn't they? And then you\nwake up with a with a social score and\nyou're just shocked and you can't\nbelieve it. How did they do this without\na\nCBDC? when the reality is you've been\ncontributing to the CBDC for the last 5\nyears. I'm just obviously making this up\nas a\nhypothetical. So, watch this very very\nclosely moving forward. And I think\nthere's a very high probability within\nthe\nnext three years that Trump issues UBI.\nI I I even if we don't have a recession\ndue to AI, I think the unemployment rate\nis probably going to get close to 10%,\nmaybe even higher. And Trump being a\npopulist, I think he's going to come in\nand he's going to do exactly what he did\nto the surveys sickness and he's going\nto start doing STEMIs, but this time\nit's going to be permanent AI stemmies\nor whatever they're going to call it.\nAnd they're going to have a easy\neasy mechanism to make this happen\nbecause what are they going to do?\nThey're going to say, \"Oh, this is no\nproblem. In order to get your UBI, the\nTreasury is just going to automatically\nset up an account for you.\" Isn't that\nconvenient? Just like the Trump accounts\nwere doing for\nbabies. You\nsee how this makes it so much easier to\nroll\nout and how the infrastructure is being\nset up by Trump himself, the guy that is\nanti-CBDC. And I believe him when he\nsays that. I don't think he's lying\nabout that. I just think it's it's is\nthe ignorance is taking him down a path\nthat he would be\nappalled that he took us on if he\nactually knew what was happening behind\nthe scenes.\nSo, I hope I'm wrong, but my base case\nis I think this leads right into uh the\nTreasury opening up accounts for people\nwhen Trump inevitably starts issuing\nUBI. And I think that's going to happen\nwithin 3 years. And when he does, that's\nwe've got a CBDC, guys, whether we like\nit or\nnot. All right, enjoy the rest of your\nafternoon. And as always, make sure you\nare standing up for freedom, liberty,\nfree market capitalism. We'll see you in\nthe next video."

      "content": "Hello fellow rubble capitals. Hope\nyou're well. So like I said in the last\nvideo, I think we will have UBI in the\nUnited States within the next three\nyears. And I'm going to explain exactly\nwhy in this video. It goes back to the\npresentation that I gave at Rebel\nCapitalist Live. So we're going to pull\nthat up. But before we do, I want to go\nover something that I saw in the news\nyesterday. And this kind of explains\nexactly where I'm going with this base\ncase that we're going to have UBI even\nfrom Donald Trump. And at the end of the\nday, like him, hate him, whatever,\nDonald Trump is definitely a populist.\nAnd if we had the unemployment rate\ngoing from six to 7 to 8 to 9 to 10,\nhe's going to step in and do something.\nHe he absolutely is. And so I think what\nhe'll probably do, he might not call it\nUBI, he might call it stmmies or\nwhatever the heck he's going to call it.\nWho knows? But effectively, it's going\nto be the exact same thing because\nyou're going to have to do something to\nprop up aggregate demand. And although\nlong-term, I think that this what's\nhappening, the transition that's\nhappening in the economy right now, I\nthink long term is going to be wildly\nbeneficial, wildly beneficial to\nsociety. But the transition period, it's\ngoing to get rough. It's going to get\nrough. It's going to get bumpy. And\nthat's if we don't have a recession. So,\nlet's go\ninto specifically what I'm referring to.\nSo, Josh, uh, I've got the screen share\nfor the desktop, but hopefully this will\nCan you Can you see the\nYeah. Can you just zoom in a little bit\non it? Uh, let me just do this. Increase\nthe size. Yeah, it looks good. How's\nthat? Okay. So yesterday, this comes out\nor the day prior. IBM cut\n8,000\njobs, mostly in HR. It's not just to\nsave money. AI is changing how the\ncompany works. IBM is using AI to do\ntasks faster, which means fewer people\nare needed for some jobs. So, a couple\nthings here. when we had Rebel Capitals\nLive over the weekend, the two or three\ndays prior is when my mastermind meets\nand we met in Orlando and this is a\nmastermind group I have with Kenny\nMaroy, Jason Hartman, uh Russ Gray, uh\nRobert Helms, the real estate guys. Uh\nKiasaki is a member, Mike Maloney is a\nmember as well. And so we meet four\ntimes a year and really try to\nstrategize to help us become better\ninvestors and also better entrepreneurs,\nmake more money, increase our freedom,\nour wealth, etc.\nSo last time we met was about three\nmonths ago and you know during these\nsessions these two or three days of\nsessions and meeting for breakfast,\nlunch, dinner, going over all of these\nstrategies that we're all implementing\nfor our investment portfolio or for our\nbusinesses. Nobody talked about AI. Not\none person. We're talking about real\nestate. We were talking about macro. We\nwere talking about gold, Bitcoin, all\nthese things. But no one talked about\nAI. And this time I started off\nthe mastermind session and it was a a\npanel with the myself, Kenny Maroy,\nHartman, uh Russ and and Robert\nHelms. And they said, \"Well, what's on\nyour mind?\" I said, \"Well, you know,\nI've been thinking about AI and I've\nbeen using it my own business and I've\nbeen using it for my own portfolio in\nRebel Capitals Pro, my model portfolios,\nand it's very interesting and you have\nto know how to work it. If you use it\njust like Google, it's like, eh, it's\nokay. It's like a faster Google that you\njust ask questions to. But if you start\ntraining it, that's where the real power\nis. And then we went down the the line\nand we talked to every single one of the\npanelists and sure enough, they're doing\nthe exact same thing. And then we\nstarted talking to some of the\nentrepreneurs that we have in our\nmastermind group. And these people are\nare very very highlevel entrepreneurs. A\nlot of them are are nine\nfigure and they're doing the exact same\nthing in their business. In fact, a lot\nof them are like Kenny where they have\nall these multif family properties and\nthey're starting to implement it for\ntheir property management, for their\nonboarding for tenants, for all these\ndifferent things where they're scaling\nback the amount of employees they need\nand uh in the process they're making\ntheir business more efficient and more\ncustomer centric. So, this for me was\nreally a light bulb moment. And then\nsure enough, when I started to talk\nabout uh when I went over my\npresentation at Rebel Capitalist Live, I\nwas the first one to present Saturday\nmorning. And that evening at the\ncocktail party, I had so many people, so\nmany attendees come up to me and say,\n\"Oh my gosh, thank you so much for\ntalking about AI.\" and they gave me\nstory after story after story about how\ntheir business is cutting back employees\nor how the the business or the\ncorporation they work for is doing the\nsame thing. In fact, one guy I spoke\nwith uh said that I won't give her name\nor title or anything like that, but she\nworks for a corporation that has 18,000\ntelemarketers.\n18,000. And right now they're and\nthey've got different levels. So if you\ncall the corporation, the first\ntelemarketer that you'll talk to if you\nget a human is going to be level one is\nwhat they call it. So they're\neliminating pretty much all their level\none customer service agents. And\nthat's as it is right now as far as how\ngood AI is. But as it continues to grow,\nI said, \"Okay, well what's your plan\nthere? Is it to eliminate level two,\nthree, four, five?\" She said, \"Yeah,\neliminate all of them.\" And the thing\nthat we have to understand\nis right now AI is as bad as it's ever\ngoing to be. Or another way to look at\nit is right now AI is 10 times\nworse than it will be in 3\nyears. And that's not just George Gam\nthat that's just a statement of fact.\nIt's just it is what it is. So, a lot of\npeople that have used AI like Google,\nthey say, \"Ah, it's not that great. It's\nnot going to replace people.\" Uh, number\none, you're you're not doing it right.\nAnd number two, you've got to realize\nthat what you're doing is you're taking\nthe way it is right now and just\nextrapolating that definitely into the\nfuture. I think it's a big big mistake.\nYou have to look at it where it was a\nyear ago and realize that in a year's\ntime, it's going to accelerate its\nevolution at a much faster pace than it\nhas over the last year. And over the\nnext year, it's going to do the exact\nsame thing. And another example that\nI'll give you is just the other day I\ntrained an AI on my voice. Now, I'm not\ngoing to play it for you right here, but\nI can assure you it's almost identical.\nAnd in fact, if if you were listening to\na George Gammon podcast and you didn't\nactually see me, I I don't think you\ncould tell the difference between the AI\nGeorge Gammon voice and the real George\nGammon voice. And it's just it is what\nit is. It's the direction we're going.\nAnother thing that I'd like to show you\nbefore we get into the UBI is this story\nI saw on the homepage of the Wall Street\nJournal. And this was a film. You see\nthis video? This is all AI, 100%. It's a\nthreeminute film that they did. This\ngal's AI, that gal is AI. Um, the robots\nare AI. This house, this kit, everything\nis AI. And they talk about how, you\nknow, this was difficult to do and it\ntook a lot of time, probably less time\nthan it would normally take, but still\nit took a lot more time than they\nthought. Um but again but what I want to\nhighlight is a it's possible and b in a\nyear's time let's just assume it took\nthem 24 hours of manpower to do do this\nusing the apps that they used. I can\nassure you if it took them 24 hours in a\nyear it'll take them 24 minutes. I can\nabsolutely assure you. So then the\nquestion becomes okay why do you need\nall these people that would have gone\ninto you know animators as an example.\nThe answer is you wouldn't need them\nbecause generative AI can just do it\nwhatever you want. So this is just\nanother example. My robot and me is the\ntitle and you can see it on the front\npage of the Wall Street Journal today\nonline. Uh I mean even this mixer, this\nblender, this is all AI. All generated\nthrough AI, the chicken breast,\neverything. So this is where it's headed\nand we have to understand that. You can\nsit there and ignore it, but I just\nthink that's ignorance and just kind of,\nyou know, just Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\nYeah. You know, putting your hands over\nyour ears kind of like the ostrich\nbearing his head in the sand and just I\ndon't think that's a good strategy\nmoving forward. So, what we have to do\nand what I like to do being the macro\nguy that I am is I like to think about\nwhat are the ramifications of this and\nhow does this impact inflation? How does\nthis impact the economy? How does this\nimpact the global\neconomy? How does this impact the value\nof the dollar? How does it impact the\nvalue of gold or bitcoin? And now I\nthink this is going to be wildly bullish\nfor gold uh UBI. I mean, of course it\nis, but\nuh there's a lot of moving parts right\nhere. So, let's go\nover why this is absolutely my base\ncase.\nand some research that I did from my\npresentation the other day. So, what I\ndid is I outlined some of the things\nthat I've done recently with AI for just\nmy own investment portfolio and creating\nindicators for Rebel Capitals Pro and\nwhatnot. Um, let's see where Oh, here's\none thing. I don't think I can show this\nnow. I'd strongly suggest you guys check\nthis out. This has audio, but I don't\nthink you'd hear it if I played it. This\nis part of my presentation. This is\nArnold Schwarzenegger's Pump Club and a\ndaily podcast that he does. You can see\nit's wildly popular. 2,000 ratings.\nThat's a lot on iTunes. That's a lot.\nAnd a 4.9 out of five. That's very, very\ngood. And you can see the host here is\nArnold\nSchwarzenegger yet\nnot. This podcast has been up for at\nleast since 2023, 2024, and it's all AI\n100%. Now, Arnold Schwarzenegger trained\nthe AI on his voice and then they\nuploaded all of the books and that he\nhad written and interviews that he had\ndone and kind of his core philosophy and\nyou know kind of the rah rah rah Tony\nRobbins type of thing and then what they\ndo is they just say okay\nAI do a daily\npodcast write the script and use\nArnold's voice and it does it without\nArnold ever lifting a finger. And now\nthey have like a supplement brand around\nit. I I think they have a monthly\nsubscription service. They have this big\nbusiness all based around this podcast\nthat people think is Arnold\nSchwarzenegger, but it's not. It's just\nAI that's been trained on his voice and\non his\nphilosophy.\nSo, just when you get a chance, go check\nit out on iTunes and just listen to 20\nseconds of a podcast and you're going to\nbe completely blown\naway. Okay, here is Goldman Sachs and\nthis was in 2023.\nNow today I think it would be far far\nmore extreme but back in 2023 they were\npredicting that the share of industry\nemployment exposed to automation by AI\nand they break things down by industry\nyou know legal 44%. uh was that office\nadministrative support 46% and it goes\ndown to building grounds cleaning as you\nwould imagine not much\n1%. But this like I said was\n2023. Today I think their numbers would\nbe much much much higher.\nSo I think it would be realistic for us\nto go above 10% for sure just due to AI\nover the next 10 years. I mean keep in\nmind right now we're at 4.2 as far as\nunemployment rate. So another 6%\nunemployment. I I don't think that's a\nstretch. Now the reason I said 20 is\nbecause you know you get a recession,\nyou get something like that or you get\nsome serious disruption and that could\nlead to the 20 number. So I'm just using\nthat as a thought experiment. But that\nwould be 33 million Americans and that's\nthree times the GFC\npeak. So economic output would collapse\nuh potentially, right? Because it's it's\nthat transition period where you say\nlike as an example\nIBM, that's great. They're going to save\na lot of money and they're likely going\nto be more productive. But what's going\nto happen to IBM's customers?\nBecause let's say IBM has a big\nconsulting wing or a consulting branch\nthat represents 50% of the revenue.\nLet's just assume that's true. Well,\nIBM's\ncustomers are going to be doing the\nexact same\nthing. And if they can use AI to replace\nIBM, why wouldn't they? So, sure, IBM is\nsaving money. That's great. But guess\nwhat? Guess what's happening to all\ntheir customers? They're not they don't\nneed IBM. a consultant. Why why why\nwould I need a consultant when I can\njust use a properly trained AI agent or\nwhatever you want? And again, notice I\nsaid properly trained because a lot of\naccountants or uh you know, people in\nthe consulting business are like, \"Well,\nI tried chat GPT and it didn't do that\ngreat of a job.\" And I'm like, \"No,\nyou're not using it the right way.\"\nJosh, can you come on here real quick?\nYeah. Okay. I've got to I just had the\ndoorbell ring so I've got to go get that\nreal quick here. Tell can you just give\nthem a bit of the a quick version as to\nwhat you're doing with AI and we won't\nname the accountant's name uh but just\nwhat you're doing on the back end is\ncreating a salesunnel that doesn't need\nany human beings involved with it\nwhatsoever. So go ahead and tell that\nstory and I'll be right back.\nYeah, I mean right now it's it's\nunbelievable for it's for actually a few\nclients training AI models based upon\ntheir business model. You can do 100%\npoint of sale close for any lead that\nyou're getting. So let's just take this\ntax client for example that this guy has\na bunch of different offers. He has a\ntax franchise where he wants other other\ntax tax guys to come into his franchise,\nbut he can also get unlimited customers.\nHe also does high-end live events. He\ndoes he has a multitude of different\noffers. So, we're trying to sell a ton\nof different things. And what we're\ndoing is making all of their organic\nmedia, which is just the social media\nstuff. And then every lead that we get,\nwe're qualifying based upon where that\nperson is best fit. And obviously you\nwant to cross-ell once they get there,\nbut we're either bringing on a tax\nclient to his live event. We're getting\nhim or getting the tax client to sign up\nto become a reoccurring customer or\nfiguring out where they're best fit and\nclosing them with no human interface\nthere or that's the that's the goal.\nWhat you really have to do is build the\na AI infrastructure for how it's going\nto be 12 months from now today. And so\nthere are some human involvement for\neach piece of what we're doing, but it's\nsubstantially less every single month\nbecause you continuously retrain the AI\nmodels to make them better and better,\nright? And you and to be clear, you're\ntraining the AI model based on this\naccountant's work and based on his\nbooks, based on all the training\nprogram. So you can you've trained the\nAI to basically be the accountant. So\nall you have to do is ask this\naccountant a question and the AI answers\nit as if it was the person himself and\ntherefore you can take that or then what\nyou can do is take that AI agent that\nyou've trained you give them a voice so\nit's indistinguishable from a human\nwhich we're very close to and now all of\na sudden that becomes your salesperson\nand that they can reach out for a phone\ncall and that's not just one salesperson\nobviously That's unlimited scale. So if\nyou have 500 people that are wanting to\ntalk to a salesperson for this\naccountant, all 500 people can have that\nphone call answered immediately without\ngoing to voicemail or anything. And it's\nand and they're talking to a fantastic\nsalesperson that they can't tell isn't a\nhuman that has been that has the skill\nset of not only a salesperson, but also\nof the accountant himself. and knowing\nall the answers to their questions and\nwhatnot. So, this is um what Josh is\ndoing. And then also, you know, he\ndidn't I don't know if he went over, but\nwhen he's creating the landing page for\nthis uh individual, you know, how's he\ndoing that? Well, what you would have\nhad to do a year ago, two years ago, is\nyou would have had to pay a copywriter,\nlet's say $25,000 to go ahead and write\nthe copy for this individual's landing\npage. And now it's zero. You I I can\nactually show you real time and share my\nscreen how you can create this landing\npage in about two seconds using AI just\nmade for that. No, you don't have to\nshow us because that's not really what\nthe video is about. The the video is\nreally I'm just trying to show people\nthat might not have a lot of experience\nwith AI where this is headed. And and\nthe the reason I'm doing this is just to\nback up my argument as to\nwhy UBI in the next 3 years is my\nabsolute base case. And you can disagree\nwith me, but you've but if you disagree\nwith me, make sure that you're\naccounting for the realities of AI and\nand not just what it is right now based\non people who aren't training it just\nusing it like Google. So getting back to\nthe the presentation Josh um let me see\nif I can expand\nthis. So basically it this would force\nthe government to consider systemic\nincome support not just temporary fixes.\nNow what I want to do is I kind of went\nback to the Great Depression because\nthat's the last time we had unemployment\nat that level. And if you remember\nduring the Great Depression, we had\nsomeone in office by the name of\nFDR. And FDR, what did he do to combat\nthe high rates of unemployment? Well, he\ndid a ton of social programs. And I'm\njust I won't go through every single one\nof these. Here we go. Historic analogy.\nIn the 1930s, Great Depression, 25%\nunemployment led to social security,\nmassive federal jobs programs, and\npermanent safety reforms. uh this was\nnot only social security but this led to\nminimum wage and several other things\nthat we now have today that they didn't\nhave in the\n1920s. So here I'm saying that UBI could\nbe the 21st century equivalent. So then\nwhat we have to do is we just have to\nask ourselves, okay, how close is Trump\nto FDR? And unless you've actually\nthought about it and done the research,\num I don't know that you'd come to the\nsame conclusion that I came to. And my\nconclusion was they're identical. I I\ndon't Once you actually look at what FDR\ndid and what Trump is doing, they're\nthey're almost indistinguishable from\none another. And let me just give you a\nquick stat to show you what I'm\nreferring to. This is the amount of\nexecutive orders signed within the first\n100 days of their presidency. Now,\nDonald Trump is number one, 143. But\nlook who's number two, three, and four.\nThat would be FDR. They're taking the\nexact same approach. FDR had a big\ndepression. Uh Donald Trump might not be\nin a depression, but he's definitely\nresiding over a\nrecession within the poor and middle\nclass. I don't think anyone on the live\nstream would deny that. Even if you\ndon't think the economy is in a\nrecession or headed for a recession,\neven if you even if you think the\neconomy is doing okay, you have to admit\nthe poor and middle class have really\nbeen struggling over the last two years\nand it's likely that they're going to\nstruggle even more. I think the simple\nfact that Donald Trump was elected is\nproof\npositive. So Donald Trump, you know,\nhe's trying to change the economy. He's\nhe sees all these things as problems.\nWhether it's the trade deficit, whether\nwe're too dependent on China, that China\nhas taken all of our middle class\nmanufacturing jobs, that we have this\ncrisis situation, this economic crisis.\nAnd I think Donald Trump is right. I\njust don't like his approach. But FDR,\nsame thing. You had this financial\ncrisis and his approach was not free\nmarket capitalism, that's for sure. It\nwas central planning and it was just,\nokay, I've got to do something. That was\nFDR's rationale. It's like\nunemployment's high. We have all these\nproblems. I can't sit back and just do\nnothing. I've got to just throw 10\nthings up against the wall and see what\nsticks.\nAnd whether you like Trump or not, I I\nthink\nit's it's very naive to think that Trump\nisn't doing the exact same thing. He's\ngot an economic problem and he's like, I\ncan't just do nothing. That's not me.\nI'm going to take the bull by the horns\nand I'm going to get out there and shake\nthings up. It's exactly what he's done\nwith tariffs. And he's going to throw 10\nthings up against the wall. He's going\nto try to negotiate. He's going to see\nwhat sticks and whatever sticks he's\ngoing to double down. I mean, this is I\nthink his\nidea. So, if we had unemployment go up\neven up above 10%. Do you really think\nTrump would sit back and do nothing and\nsay, \"Oh, well, let's just let the free\nmarket take care of it.\" I come on. Come\non. He's going to do the exact same\nthing as\nFDR. And what FDR did was just basically\na\n1930s version of UBI.\nSo now let's go to what I think the\noutcome is going to be from a standpoint\nof economics and how I'm looking at this\nfor my own portfolio and how what\nadjustments I want to make or what my\nwhat I think the long-term trends are\ngoing to be if we get this UBI or if\nDonald Trump just keeps doing what he's\ndoing and we have these issues with the\nunemployment rate going up. uh due to AI\nor a combination of that with a\nrecession. So, we've had two\ninflationary decades in the United\nStates. Most people forget the 1940s, we\nhad extreme inflation. Uh they consider\nthe 1970s the inflationary decade\nbecause it was more of a a consistent\ninflation. We didn't have outright\ndeflation like we had in the 1940s. Uh\nalthough we had significant disinflation\nas you guys know from watching my videos\nor you can just tell from this chart\nright here. This red line represents\nthis the headline\nCPI. So notice at the beginning of the\n1940s we have a huge spike in inflation.\nSo this would be probably going up over\n10 12%. I this is pro this is going to\nbe zero right here. That's going to be\n10%. That's going to be 20%. Why is\nthis? Well, we had massive supply shocks\nbecause we had to take everything that\nwe were using to manufacture stuff and\nwe had to manufacture tanks and bombs\nand, you know, just military\nsupplies. So, you have a huge supply\nshock at the beginning of the\ndecade. Does that sound\nfamiliar? And then you have a uh, you\nknow, it comes back down. But then what\ndo you have? You have price controls.\nAnd I think that's one of the main\nreasons why it came back down, by the\nway. So you had price controls in the\n1940s. Most people forgot about that.\nThey think price controls was just\nsomething in the 1970s. It wasn't. So\nthen once they lifted the price\ncontrols, as you would imagine, what\nhappens? The prices skyrocket. But then\nthey come right back down because all\nthese high prices, wages aren't going up\nto the same degree. So this decreases\naggregate demand, which means economic\noutput decreases. And then you get a\nhuge recession which leads to actual\ndeflation. So in 1947 the inflation rate\nwas at 19%. 1 n 1\nn and just a year or two later it's at\n-2.7\ndeflation. So I think it and another\nthing that uh Lynn Alder my good friend\npoints out is you did have an increase\nin the money supply right here.\nsubstantial increase, but it wasn't a\nresult of the banks\nlending. Absolutely not. It was a result\nof central\nplanning. It was it was a result of what\nthe government was doing. They were\nactually creating more currency units,\nactual more broad money, not just base\nmoney. Now juxtapose this to the\n1970s where the increase in money supply\nthat led there that was definitely a\ncontributor to the amount of inflation\nthat we saw was a result of the banks.\nIt was the banks creating all these\ncurrency units. So right now you guys\nknow from watching my videos the banks\nreally aren't playing ball. Now you saw\nM2 go up significantly in 2021 2022. Why\nwas that? because the banks were just\nlending money hand over fist. Not\nreally. uh and if they it was a result\nor you know a component or a percentage\nof that big 25% increase that we got in\n2021 2022 in M2 a percentage of that was\nabsolutely bank lending but that was\nbecause it was guaranteed by the\ngovernment that was PPP that was uh a\nlot of these lines of credit that uh you\nknow the government implicitly backs\nstopped and then a com then a percentage\nof that was just QE because they were\nbuying from non-banks and that along\nwith increasing velocity because you're\ntaking from savers and giving it to\nspenders in the form of stimmy checks\nand then you combine that with a supply\nshock, what are you going to get? You're\ngoing to get inflation. In fact, it was\nsurprising that the headline number\nwasn't even higher. Obviously, the real\nnumber was a lot higher than 9.1%. But\nyou guys see where I'm going with this?\nThe the massive increase in inflation\nthat we got or even the money supply, it\nwasn't exclusively a result of banks\njust lending more. uh in fact I think um\nindirectly and directly it was more so a\nresult of the central planners and then\nthe inflation was obviously a result of\nthe central planners because they're the\none that locked up everyone in a cage\nshut down the economy and created the\nsupply shock which was the main\ncontributor to inflation as a result of\ntheir policies for the surveys sickness\nonce the surveys sickness it was the\npolicies\nSo the main takeaway from this video is\njust me outlining kind of my broad\n30,000 foot level base case for UBI in\nthe next call it three years definitely\nin the next 5 years and then going over\nthe economic takeaways which I think\nmeans the 2020s look a lot like the\n1940s not so much like the 1970s and\nwhen I mean the 1940s I mean these huge\nspikes in inflation and then massive\ndisinflation to a point where we could\nsee\ndeflation and keep in mind what's going\nto happen if AI is taking all the jobs\nthey're going to lower the prices and\nthat's just like my good buddy Jeff\nBooth always talks about now you've got\nthese two counterbal you know we call it\nI was talking to Macintosh the other day\nand we were talking about the immovable\nobject and the unstoppable force well\nthe immovable object is the US economy\nin fact the global economy\nfundamentally would\ndeflate. So this is because the debts\nare so high. We would have deflation.\nAnd I'm not talking about disinflation.\nI'm talking about deflation where prices\ngo down, asset prices plummet. That's if\nwe didn't have the unstoppable force of\nthe government. You guys call it money\nprinting, whatever you want to call it.\nThese are the two things that are at\nplay all the time. And it's the economic\ndistortions the government creates. It's\nall of these things.\nSo, in the 2020s, I think you're going\nto have a lot of both. You're going to\nhave potential deflation due to AI and\nthe debts being so huge, but then you're\ngoing to have the governments and the\ncentral planners and authoritarians\ntrying to push back against that\ndeflation, doing everything they can\nwith the unstoppable force that will and\nI wouldn't doubt it. They did price\ncontrols. Who knows what they're going\nto do that which and whatever they do I\nthink it's going to lead to these huge\nspikes and then once they stop then the\nn the the the fundamentals of the\neconomy crashing you know is what\ncreates this deflation and then you go\nright back into another wave when the\ngovernment comes out and starts their\nnext round of policies. Right? So, I\nthink quite frankly, I I\nwouldn't put it past Trump to issue the\nUBI prices spike and then do price\ncontrols. I mean, he's kind of hinting\nat doing that now with the\npharmaceuticals. Now, you can say that's\na good move. Fine. What? Whatever. It's\nthat's your opinion. That's not really\nthe point. The point is that's a price\ncontrol. And he's talking to Walmart.\nNow, he's not saying Walmart can't\nincrease their prices, but he's\nsuggesting that they\ndon't. And then look at what he's doing\nwith uh\nApple. He's saying, \"Well, okay, if you\ndon't manufacture iPhones here, you get\na 25% tariff.\" Now, you could say that's\na great move. Okay, fine. That's a great\nmove. The bottom line is that's not too\nfar away. That's at a big stretch for\nTrump to just come out and say, \"Okay,\nyou can't increase your\nprices.\" And\nso, I think we're going to see 2020s\nlook a lot like the 1940s and not as\nmuch like the\n1970s. Okay, guys. So, then the question\nbecomes, what do you do about it? And I\nknow I'm kind of preaching to the choir\nright now, but I I think you have to own\ngold. I mean, it's not investment\nadvice, but that's what I do with my\nportfolio. And those of you who are\nRebel Capitalists Pro members, you know\nthat I've got a couple uh model\nportfolios in there. And each model\nportfolio, I always start with 10% gold,\nregardless of the price. Just it's an\ninsurance policy. To me, it's a complete\nno-brainer. And what moves the price of\ngold? I don't know if it's really the\ninverse of the dollar. Sure. A lot of\npeople think that. A lot of people think\nit's negative or positive real interest\nrates. I don't see a lot of evidence for\nthat if you look at it historically.\nSome people think it's geopolitics. Nah,\nmaybe. A lot of people think it's M2.\nNot really. Definitely not the\nDXY. To me, the thing that really moves\nthe price of gold is\nuncertainty. And it's not just\nuncertainty globally. I think it's also\nuncertainty with the monetary\nsystem and the more confidence that we\nhave in the monetary system. I think\ngold goes down. I mean you saw that in\nthe 1990s but then once we start getting\nuh where things aren't as secure and we\nstart wondering is this going to all\nfall apart here? Is this going to\ndeteriorate? I don't want any\ncounterparty risk. I think that's really\nthe value in gold among I think that's\nthe main value I should say in gold is\nno counterparty risk and in today's\nworld you know at the end of a fourth\nturning everything that we talked about\nmy view going into a massive techn\ntechnological disruption which is AI and\nthen possibly going into the 1940s I I I\nthink regardless of what your views are\nwe're probably going to have more\nuncertainty cy as opposed to less\nuncertainty and in that environment I\nthink gold does extremely\nwell. I like uranium. That's another\nthing that we talked about at Rebel\nCapital SL. Rick Rule was at uh Rebel\nCapital Live and one thing that I loved\nuh in his presentation is he said the\nthe best investments he's ever made in\nhis life uh the ones with the highest\nreturn, you know, the 10 baggers, the 20\nbaggers, the 30 baggers are when he has\nto answer the question of\nwhen as opposed to the question of\nif. Right? So he was using uranium as an\nexample. It's not if the price goes up\nby, you know, two or three fold. It's\njust a matter of when. Because if the\nprice doesn't go up by that much, you\nwon't be able to turn on the lights. Or\nif the price doesn't go up by that much,\nyou're not going to be able to use\nAI. So it's it's a pretty uh easy\nconclusion that this is a when question,\nnot an if question.\nSo that that's another thing that I I\nreally like and I think that we're going\nin a commodity super cycle. And what's\nthe one constraint with AI? What's the\none constraint? Because we're talking\nabout this doing everything and taking\nover jobs and all these things. That's\nright. But at the end of the day, it has\nto have\nenergy. AI with no energy does\nnothing. You can't have it with no\nenergy. So if it is true, it's going to\ntake over all these jobs. then the\namount of energy that we have to have\naccess to needs to go up\nexponentially. And you guys know that\nyou can't just turn on a light switch\nand get more energy. Therefore, the\nprice will likely have to go\nup. So, going back to gold, one of the\nthings that I want to talk about is\nwe've had an incredible sponsor here on\nthe channel, Monetary Metals. And one\nthing I love about monetary metals is\nyou can actually get paid to store your\ngold with them. Now, a lot of people\ndon't really understand the process. So,\nJosh is going to put a whiteboard\nexplainer video I did in the uh probably\npinned comment in the description. So,\nI'd strongly encourage you to check that\nout because um what they do is it's gold\nleasing where they lease it to jewelers\nand once you go through their business\nmodel, it makes a lot of sense. But I've\nhad gold stored with them for a few\nmonths now and it's gone very very well\nand I'm collecting about a three or\n3.5% return on the gold I have stored\nwith them. And again, the cool thing is\nit's paid in gold. So if you want to\ncheck that out, just go to what is it,\nJosh? I think it's right\nhere. It's\nmonetary-metals.com. I think you can do\nforward slash\nwhat's oh\nforwardgamin and uh just tell them that\nI sent you and call the customer service\npeople if you want to find out about\nfind uh more about it find out more\nabout it and they can answer all of your\nquestions but do watch that explainer\nvideo because I know a lot of you have\ngold I think all of you should have it\num and I don't keep 100% of my gold over\nthere because the main reason you have\ngold is because it doesn't have any\ncounterparty risk\nBut, uh, for the percentage that I'm\ncomfortable storing, uh, with another\nfacility, uh, I just shoot it over\nthere. Like I said, it's worked really\nwell. And I know Keith Weiner well,\nsuper smart guy. I like him a lot. And I\nwould suggest that if you want to figure\nout how to not only not pay storage, but\nget that interest rate, get paid to own\ngold, uh, I would strongly suggest\nchecking it out. Getting back to the\ncommodities, what we were talking about\nat Rebel Capitals Live with Rick Rule,\nguys like Chris Macintosh is going into\na commodity super cycle because if it is\ntrue, robots are going to be doing\neverything. And I I don't know how far\nalong we are there. Obviously, we can\nprogress a lot faster with AI like chat\nGPT and whatnot and doing things like\ncopywriting or doing HR duties or\naccounting duties. you can that evolves\nat the speed of light. Uh but the the\nrobotics, you know, that's a physical\ngood in the real world. I think that's\ngoing to take a lot longer, but I think\nthat's the direction that we're\ndefinitely going to go. And what does\nthat require? That requires a lot of\nholes in the\nground. And you guys know what I mean by\nthat. It takes a lot of commodities,\nthat's for sure. And I just I I don't\nthink a lot of people are prepared for\nAI. And I definitely don't think even a\nlot of the producers and the people that\nare working on these AI problems, I\ndon't think they really understand how\nmany resources with alternative uses,\nscarce resources by the way, this is\ngoing to take. And so I think this is\ngoing to be the theme for the rest or\none of the themes, one of the big macro\nthemes for the next yeah 19 next 5 years\nat least maybe next 10 years is is\ncommodities. And look at what Trump is\ndoing. It's delization. That's very\nbullish for commodities as well. So I'm\nnot saying go out and buy them. Uh you\nknow if we go into a recession likely\nthese commodity prices will come down.\nBut I do love Rick's approach and when\nyou're considering uh buying an asset,\nbuying a commodity, buying a stock,\nbuying a bond, try to find questions\nwhere it's an it's a when question when\nthe rates go down to 4%. Let's just say\nI'm not saying they will, but that's an\nexample. When the price of oil goes up,\nthat's a great example going back to the\nsurvea sickness. You know, when oil got\ndown to\n$37 a barrel, I'm sure you guys remember\nthat. That's a perfect example of what\nRick's saying. To say that the price of\noil is going to go above -37. That is\nnot an if\nquestion. That is simply a when question\nand that's where you make a lot of\nmoney. So try when you're going through\nthis stuff. If your base case is similar\nto mine with AI, the 1940s, everything\nthat we've talked about, try to look for\ninvestment opportunities where you're\nasking that when question as opposed to\nan if\nquestion. All right, guys, on that\nbombshell, enjoy the rest of your\nevening. Make sure that you're standing\nup for freedom, liberty, free market,\ncapitalism. Definitely check out\nMonetary Medals. Tell them George Gammon\nsent you. The customer service people\nare great. and we'll see you in the next\nvideo."
